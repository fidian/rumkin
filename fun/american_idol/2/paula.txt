I didn't expect to hear a pop voice come out of you.
It was really interesting, but it was really refreshing.
I think you did do alright.
You have a very rich tone.
You did fall flat in some areas.
Now, you do have a personality.  You really, really do.
You have a great personality.  You really, really do.
You have a real wonderful voice.
It is hard to sing that song.
But, you did your thing.
You did it really well.
Good job.
I think you've come a long way.
I think you did really well today.
That song is not the easiest one to sing, and I think you did your thing.
I like the twist at the end.
A little pitchy kinda in the middle, but overall good.
You really put your all into it, especially at the end when you put your
passion/gut into it.
Passion is everything.
I think that this is what you call a "seamless, beautiful, perfect performance."
You did an amazing, amazing, brilliant, stupendous job.
Unbelievable.
It's amazing.
Honey, you sang off-key, almost the entire song.  You don't hear that?  \
You don't hear that when you're singing?
You didn't sing remotely near the next American Idol that we'll pick.
Nice voice.  Very nice voice.
I think you'll come to Hollywood and nail it.
No.  I'm sorry.  I don't think you did a great job here.
I love it.  I love you.
Really deep down inside, when you ask yourself, "Am I really a good singer?"  \
Would you really, in your soul, think you are a good singer?
You have a great voice.  Smooth.
Amazing from the first note to the very last.  Brilliant.
Oh boy.  I'm speechles.  Quite honestly, I don't know what to say.
I think you are a beautiful girl.  You came in looking great.
Very pure, very crystal clear, and very mature for your age.  Very very nice.
Good job.  Nice voice.  Very nice.
I've never seen so much committment from a contestant.  You're totally
committed and I love you for that.  You're very committed.
*stunned silence*
Good voice.  Way to go.
Wow.  I think you have the X factor.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Wonerful.
Really unique.  And a nice song.  You nailed it.
You have a unique sound.
You really are beautiful.  You oversang the song.
I really really like your voice.  I do.  I really love the song selection.
I'm seeing a lot of oversinging.  I feel that once again, subtlety is key.
Work on your showmanship because you have a real nice voice.
You are stunning.  The camera loves you.
Amazing!
Unbelievable!  Unbelieveable!
Great song.
I'm telling you, you just blew me away.  Blew me away.
What a beautiful voice, and different.  Unique.  Refreshing.
In tune all the way!
Brilliant.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.
I think you have amazing star quality.
I don't know if it was the right key for you.  You were a little under the \
whole way through.
This is what this competition's about.
You raised the bar.  You surpassed the bar.
You're a star.
You have this confidence about you that is quiet and subtle.  It's not \
intimidating, and you welcome everybody in.
Yeah, I liked it.  Lots.  I really did.
I definately fell that you did a much better job.  I was a little concerned, \
especially with the song.
Good job.
You shine tonight.  You shine.
Amazing.
I'm speechless.  I ... I really ... I ... I don't know what to say.
You have a real nice voice.  You really do.  I like the tone in your voice \
when you're not going for the power, because when you do go for the power, \
you tend to overdo the vibrato.  Just harness back a little bit.  You've got \
a beautiful voice.
I was hoping that you were going to give a better audition.  I think \
you've just kinda checked out for a minute.  I think your nerves kinda \
overtook the audition.
I think you have a great voice.
I think this is one of the better voices we've heard.
Thank you God.
Great.
I think you've got a nice voice, but I wasn't crazy about the song choice \
for you.
I really dig it.
It was a breath of fresh air.
Pick a better song that is more apropriate for singing solo acapella.
You have a very nice voice.
I think you've got star quality.  I really do.  I liked you a lot.
Good job.  Very nice.
Interesting choices.  Very confident.
I closed my eyes and I'm looking for some glitches.  You have such a \
brilliant voice.  It's magnificent.  My God.  I just think that you've got a \
great whole vibe about you and embrace it.
Unbelievable.
a little pitchy a little bit.  You didn't reach quite the high notes.
You are adorable.  You have a smooth voice.  I like the choice of song.  \
Good job.
You have a beautiful voice.  You were very original with how you changed up \
the song.  I think you're beautiful.
Amazing performance.  Amazing.  Your voice is amazing.
I so blown away.  I'm like mesmorized.  Brilliant.  Gorgeous.
It wasn't the best, best performance.
I think you're absolutely beautiful.
I think you did a great job.
You look very comfortable on that stage.  Your whole vibe.  You're there.  \
You worked it out.
Your voice, perfect song.  I felt it.
I would only work on just giving it more on the stage and really commanding \
it.  Other than that, wow!
Yeah, a little pitchy.  A lot of fun.  Great personality.
I thought you gave a real good performance, and your voice is what makes you \
very unique in this competition and very refreshing.
You know what?  You're either born with it, or you're not.  You were born \
with it.
Your voice is truly amazing.
You took some risks and it sounded good.
That was seamless.
You have the most amazing, amazing stage presence.  You look beautiful \
tonight.  You really know how to work that microphone and that stage.  \
It's as if you've been born to do what you were doing, right now on that \
stage.
You are effortless with your voice.  You are so natural.
Excellent job.  Excellent job.
A lot of fun.  I think the best is yet to come.
That was not my favorite performance so far.  Having said that though, you
still look great and you did a great job.
You just gave such an emotional, touching, eloquent performance and you were \
in it.  You didn't overperform it.  You brought us all into your performance.
You picked the perfect song for your register of voice.  The most perfect, \
perfect song I've ever heard in my life.
I think you had a lot of energy tonight.  I think you did a good rendition \
of the song.
I heard that you were off-pitch.
I'm wishing for you to stretch your performance, and invite different colors \
and textures to your voice to broaden your range.  I think that if you take \
those risks, you're going to see great rewards because you are a true \
performer, so I just hope that you can broaden that a little bit.
Mmm.  Yes.  There's going to be a lot of baby-makin' tonight.
Great job.

It will make my batter better."<br>
So, she bought a bit of butter<br>
And she put it in her batter<br>
And it made her batter better.<br>
(Shouldn't bitter butter make Betty Botter's batter bitter?<br>
Or is bitter batter from bitter butter better?)</p>

<p>Betty Botter had some butter,<br>
"But," she said, "the butter's bitter.<br>
If I bake this bitter butter,<br>
It would make my batter bitter.<br>
But a bit of better butter,<br>
That would make my batter better."<br>
So she bought a bit of butter,<br>
Better than her bitter butter,<br>
And she baked it in her batter;<br>
And the batter was not bitter<br>
So 'twas better Betty Botter<br>
Bought a bit of better butter.</p>

to doctor the doctor; not the way the doctored doctor wants to be
doctored.)</p>

<p>A tree toad loved a she-toad who lived up in a tree.<br>
He was a two-toed tree toad but a three-toed was she.<br>

But the two-toed tree toad tried in vain.  He couldn't please her whim.<br>
From her tree toad bower with her three-toed power the she-toad vetoed
him.</p>

Had Soar seen See's saw before See sawed Soar's seesaw,<br>
See's saw would not have sawed Soar's seesaw.<br>
So See's saw sawed Soar's seesaw.<br>
But it was sad to see Soar so sore just because See's saw sawed Soar's
seesaw.</p>

<p>You've no need to light a night-light<br>
On a light night like tonight,<br>
For a night-light's light's a slight light,<br>
And tonight's a night that's light.<br>

It is really not quite right<br>
To light night-lights with their slight lights<br>
On a light night like tonight.</p>

<p>Tongue twisters are fun little exercises for your mouth.  They often use
alliteration (the repeating of the beginning sounds of words) and rhyme in
order to force you to verbally "stumble" instead of speaking clearly.
The mistake will usually produce a smile in those listening to your 
attempt.</p>

<p>You can check out the various tongue twisters on the other pages in this
section.  A good place to start is with the "5 Times Fast" category.</p>

<p>If you know of a tongue twister that you would like to see listed on
these pages, just type it into the chat box on the bottom of any of these
pages.  Please make sure it is not already listed before suggesting that
I add it.</p>

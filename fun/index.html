<p>I keep a smattering of entertaining things on my site. Not much, but perhaps something here can brighten your day.</p><ul><li><p><a href=fortune-cookie/ >Fortune Cookie</a> - Did you just eat a meal and now you need a fortune? I collect mine and randomly give them back out to website visitors.</p></li><li><p><a href=tests/ >Personality Tests</a> - Probably mostly meaningless, but entertaining. You won&#x27;t need to enter your email address or register to get the results because that would be silly.</p></li><li><p><a href=tongue-twisters/ >Tongue Twisters</a> - A large collection of phrases and verses that are challenging to properly say. A great way to work our your mouth muscles.</p></li></ul>

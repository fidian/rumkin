<H1>Non-Chemical Technologies for Scale and 
Hardness&nbsp;Control</H1><I>Technology for improving energy efficiency through 
the removal or prevention of&nbsp;scale. </I>
<P>Abstract</P>
<P>The magnetic technology has been cited in the literature and investigated 
since the turn of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, when lodestones and naturally 
occurring magnetic mineral formations were used to decrease the formation of 
scale in cooking and laundry applications. Today, advances in magnetic and 
electrostatic scale control technologies have led to their becoming reliable 
energy savers in certain applications.</P>
<P>For example, magnetic or electrostatic scale control technologies can be used 
as a replacement for most water-softening equipment. Specifically, chemical 
softening (lime or lime-soda softening), ion exchange, and reverse osmosis, when 
used for the control of hardness, could potentially be replaced by non-chemical 
water conditioning technology. This would include applications both to cooling 
water treatment and boiler water treatment in once-through and recirculating 
systems.</P>
<P>The primary energy savings from this technology result from decrease in 
energy consumption in heating or cooling applications. This savings is 
associated with the prevention or removal of scale build-up on a heat exchange 
surface, where even a thin film can increase energy consumption by nearly 10%. 
Secondary energy savings can be attributed to reducing the pump load, or system 
pressure, required to move the water through a scale-free, unrestricted piping 
system.</P>
<P>This <I>Federal Technology Alert</I> provides information and procedures that 
a Federal energy manager needs to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this 
technology. The process of magnetic or eletrostatic scale control and its energy 
savings and other benefits are explained. Guidelines are provided for 
appropriate application and installation. In addition, a hypothetical case study 
is presented to give the reader a sense of the actual costs and energy savings. 
A listing of current manufacturers and technology users is provided along with 
references for further reading.</P>

<A name=about>
<H2>About the Technology</H2></A>The technology addressed in this FTA uses a 
magnetic or electrostatic field to alter the reaction between scale-forming ions 
in hard water. Hard water contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other 
divalent cations. When subjected to heating, the divalent ions form insoluble 
compounds with anions such as carbonate. These insoluble compounds have a much 
lower heat transfer capability than heat transfer surfaces such as metal. They 
are insulators. Thus additional fuel consumption would be required to transfer 
an equivalent amount of energy. 
<P></P>
<P>The magnetic technology has been cited in the literature and investigated 
since the turn of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century, when lodestones or naturally 
occurring magnetic mineral formations were used to decrease the formation of 
scale in cooking and laundry applications. However, the availability of 
high-power, rare-earth element magnets has advanced the magnetic technology to 
the point where it is more reliable. Similar advances in materials science, such 
as the availability of ceramic electrodes and other durable dielectric 
materials, have allowed the electrostatic technology to also become more 
reliable. 
<P>The general operating principle for the magnetic technology is a result of 
the physics of interaction between a magnetic field and a moving electric 
charge, in this case in the form of an ion. When ions pass through the magnetic 
field, a force is exerted on each ion. The forces on ions of opposite charges 
are in opposite directions. The redirection of the particles tends to increase 
the frequency with which ions of opposite charge collide and combine to form a 
mineral precipitate, or insoluble compound. Since this reaction takes place in a 
low-temperature region of a heat exchange system, the scale formed is 
non-adherent. At the prevailing temperature conditions, this form is preferred 
over the adherent form, which attaches to heat exchange surfaces. 
<P>The operating principles for the electrostatic units are much different. 
Instead of causing the dissolved ions to come together and form non-adherent 
scale, a surface charge is imposed on the ions so that they repel instead of 
attract each other. Thus the two ions (positive and negative, or cations and 
anions, respectively) of a kind needed to form scale are never able to come 
close enough together to initiate the scale-forming reaction. The end result for 
a user is the same with either technology; scale formation on heat exchange 
surfaces is greatly reduced or eliminated. 
<H3>Application Domain</H3>
<P>These technologies can be used as a replacement for most water-softening 
equipment. Specifically, chemical softening (lime or lime-soda softening), ion 
exchange, and reverse osmosis (RO), when used for the control of hardness, can 
be replaced by the non-chemical water conditioning technology. This would 
include applications both to cooling water treatment and boiler water treatment, 
in once-through and recirculating systems. Other applications mentioned by the 
manufacturers include use on petroleum pipelines as a means of decreasing 
fouling caused by wax build-up, and the ability to inhibit biofouling and 
corrosion.</P>
<P>The magnetic technology is generally not applicable in situations where the 
hard water contains "appreciable" concentrations of iron. In this FTA, 
appreciable means a concentration requiring iron treatment or removal prior to 
use, on the order of parts per million or mg/L. The reason for this precaution 
is that the action of the magnetic field on the hardness-causing ions is very 
weak. Conversely, the action of the magnetic field on the iron ions is very 
strong, which interferes with the water conditioning action.</P>
<P>A search of the Thomas Register<FONT size=-1><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> in 
conjunction with manufacturer contact yielded eleven manufacturers of magnetic, 
electromagnetic or electrostatic water conditioning equipment that fell within 
the scope of this investigation. The defined scope includes commercial- or 
industrial-type magnetic, electromagnetic or electrostatic devices marketed for 
scale control. Devices intended for home use, as well as other non-chemical 
means for scale control, such as reverse osmosis, are not within the extended 
scope of this FTA.</P>

  <P><B>Figure 1. Diagram of General Magnetic Device 
Construction</B></P></CENTER>Exact numbers of units deployed by these 
manufacturers are virtually impossible to compile, as some of the manufacturers 
had been selling the technology for up to 40 years. One manufacturer claims as 
many as 1,000,000 units (estimated total of all manufacturers represented here) 
are installed in the field. Where not withheld by the manufacturer because of 
business sensitivity reasons, customer lists included both Federal and 
non-Federal installations. Those manufacturers who did withhold the customer 
list indicated a willingness to disclose customer contacts to legitimate 
prospective customers.
<P></P>
<P>Literature provided by and discussions with manufacturers described a typical 
installation for a boiler water treatment scheme as including the device 
installed upstream of the boiler. Manufacturers vary in their preference of 
whether the device should be installed close to the water inlet or close to the 
boiler. Both locations have been documented as providing adequate performance. 
Generally, the preferred installation location for use with cooling towers or 
heat exchangers is upstream of the heat exchange location and upstream of the 
cooling tower. Downstream of the cooling tower but upstream of the heat source 
was also mentioned as a possible installation location, primarily for the use 
with chillers or other cooling equipment.</P>
<P>The primary <I>caveat</I> on installation of the magnetic technology is that 
high voltage (230V, 3-phase or above) power lines interfere with operation by 
imposing a second magnetic field on the water. (This is most noticeable when 
these electric power sources are installed within three feet of a magnetic 
device.) This second magnetic field most likely will not be aligned with the 
magnetic field of the device, thus introducing interference and reducing the 
effectiveness of the treatment. Installations near high voltage power lines are 
to be avoided if possible. Where avoidance is not possible, the installation of 
shielded equipment is recommended to achieve optimum operation. Some 
manufacturers also have limitations on direction of installation--vertical or 
horizontal--because of internal mechanical construction</P>
<H3>Energy-Savings Mechanism</H3>
<P>The primary energy savings result from a decrease in energy consumption in 
heating or cooling applications. This savings is associated with the prevention 
or removal of scale build-up on a heat exchange surface where even a thin film 
(1/32" or 0.8 mm) can increase energy consumption by nearly 10%. Example savings 
resulting from the removal of calcium-magnesium scales are shown in Table 1. A 
secondary energy savings can be attributed to reducing the pump load, or system 
pressure, required to move the water through a scale-free, unrestricted piping 
system.</P>

<P>As was discussed above, magnetic and electric fields interact with a 
resultant force generated in a direction perpendicular to the plane formed by 
the magnetic and electric field vectors. (See Figure 2 for an illustration.) 
This force acts on the current carrying entity, the ion. Positively charged 
particles will move in a direction in accord with the Right-hand Rule, where the 
electric and magnetic fields are represented by the fingers and the force by the 
thumb. Negatively charged particles will move in the opposite direction. This 
force is in addition to any mixing in the fluid due to turbulence.</P>
<CENTER>
  <P><IMG height=159 
src="11_fig2.gif" 
width=250> 
  <P><B>Figure 2. Diagram Showing Positioning of Fields and Force</B></P></CENTER>
<P>The result of these forces on the ions is that, in general, positive charged 
ions (calcium and magnesium, primarily) and negative charged ions (carbonate and 
sulfate, primarily) are directed toward each other with increased velocity. The 
increased velocity should result in an increase in the number of collisions 
between the particles, with the result being formation of insoluble particulate 
matter. Once a precipitate is formed, it serves as a foundation for further 
growth of the scale crystal. The treatment efficiency increases with increasing 
hardness since more ions are present in solution; thus each ion will need to 
travel a shorter distance before encountering an ion of opposite charge.</P>
<P>A similar reaction occurs at a heat exchange surface but the force on the 
ions results from the heat input to the water. Heat increases the motion of the 
water molecules, which in turn increases the motion of the ions, which then 
collide. In addition, scale exhibits an inverse solubility relationship with 
temperature, meaning that the solubility of the material decreases as 
temperature increases. Therefore, at the hottest point in a heat exchanger, the 
heat exchange surface, the scale is least soluble, and, furthermore due to 
thermally induced currents, the ions are most likely to collide nearest the 
surface. As above, the precipitate formed acts as a foundation for further 
crystal growth. </P>
<P>When the scale-forming reaction takes place within a heat exchanger, the 
mineral form of the most common scale is called calcite. Calcite is an adherent 
mineral that causes the build-up of scale on the heat exchange surface. When the 
reaction between positively charged and negatively charged ions occurs at low 
temperature, relative to a heat exchange surface, the mineral form is usually 
aragonite. Aragonite is much less adherent to heat exchange surfaces, and tends 
to form smaller-grained or softer-scale deposits, as opposed to the monolithic 
sheets of scale common on heat exchange surfaces. </P>
<P>These smaller-grained or softer-scale deposits are stable upon heating and 
can be carried throughout a heating or cooling system while causing little or no 
apparent damage. This transport property allows the mineral to be moved through 
a system to a place where it is convenient to collect and remove the solid 
precipitate. This may include removal with the wastewater in a once-through 
system, with the blowdown in a recirculating system, or from a device such as a 
filter, water/solids separator, sump or other device specifically introduced 
into the system to capture the precipitate.</P>
<P>Water savings are also possible in recirculating systems through the 
reduction in blowdown necessary. Blowdown is used to reduce or balance out the 
minerals and chemical concentrations within the system. If the chemical 
consumption for scale control is reduced, it may be possible to reduce blowdown 
also. However, the management of corrosion inhibitor and/or biocide build-up, 
and/or residual products or degradation by-products, may become the controlling 
factor in determining blowdown frequency and volume.</P>
<H3>Other Benefits</H3>
<P>Aside from the energy savings, other potential areas for savings exist. The 
first is elimination or significant reduction in the need for scale and hardness 
control chemicals. In a typical plant, this savings could be on the order of 
thousands of dollars each year when the cost of chemicals, labor and equipment 
is factored in. Second, periodic descaling of the heat exchange equipment is 
virtually eliminated. Thus process downtime, chemical usage, and labor 
requirements are eliminated. A third potential savings is from reductions in 
heat exchanger tube replacement due to failure. Failure of tubes due to scale 
build-up, and the resultant temperature rise across the heat exchange surface, 
will be eliminated or greatly reduced in proportion to the reduction in scale 
formation.</P>
<H3>Variations</H3>
<P>Devices are available in two installation variations and three operational 
variations. First to be discussed are the two installation variations: invasive 
and non-invasive. Invasive devices are those which have part or all of the 
operating equipment within the flow field. Therefore, these devices require the 
removal of a section of the pipe for insertion of the device. This, of course, 
necessitates an amount of time for the pipe to be out of service. Non-invasive 
devices are completely external to the pipe, and thus can be installed while the 
pipe is in operation. Figure 3 illustrates the two installation variations.</P>

<P>Electrostatic units are always invasive. The other two types can be either 
invasive or non-invasive. The devices illustrated in Figure 3 are examples of 
permanent magnet devices.</P>
<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>Most of the devices are in-line--some invasive, some non-invasive--as opposed 
to side-stream. The invasive devices require a section of pipe to be removed and 
replaced with the device. Most of the invasive devices are larger in diameter 
than the section of pipe they replace. The increased diameter is partially a 
function of the magnetic or electromagnetic elements, and also a function of the 
cross sectional flow area. The flow area through the devices is generally 
equivalent to the flow area of the section of pipe removed.</P>
<P>The non-invasive in-line devices are designed to be wrapped around the pipe. 
Thus downtime, or line out-of-service time, is minimized or eliminated.</P>

<H2>Federal Sector Potential</H2></A>
<P>The potential cost-effective savings achievable by this technology were 
estimated as part of the technology assessment process of the New Technology 
Demonstration Program (NTDP).</P>
<H3>Technology Screening Process</H3>
<P>New technologies were solicited for NTDP participation through advertisements 
in the <I>Commerce Business Daily</I> and trade journals, and, primarily, 
through direct correspondence. Responses were obtained from manufacturers, 
utilities, trade associations, research institutes, Federal sites and other 
interested parties. Based on these responses, the technologies were evaluated in 
terms of potential Federal-sector energy savings and procurement, installation, 
and maintenance costs. They were also categorized as either just coming to 
market ("unproven" technologies) or as technologies for which field data already 
exist ("proven" technologies). </P>
<P>The energy savings and market potentials of each candidate technology were 
evaluated using a modified version of the Facility Energy Decisions Screening 
(FEDS) software tool<A 
href="http://www.aqua-correct.dk/dk1skw/11foot_a.htm"><SUP>(a)</SUP></A> (Dirks 
and Wrench, 1993).</P>
<P>Non-chemical water treatment technologies were judged life-cycle 
cost-effective (at one or more Federal sites) in terms of installation cost, net 
present value, and energy savings. In addition, significant environmental 
savings from the use of many of these technologies are likely through reductions 
in CO<SUB>2</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and SO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions.</P>
<H3>Estimated Savings and Market Potential</H3>
<P>As part of the NTDP selection process, an initial technology screening 
activity was performed to estimate the potential market impact in the Federal 
sector. Two technologies were run through the assessment methodology. The first 
technology was assessed assuming the technology was applied to the treatment of 
boiler make-up water. The second technology was assessed assuming the technology 
was applied to both the treatment of boiler make-up water and cooling tower 
water treatment. The technology screenings used the economic basis required by 
10 CFR 436. The costs of the two technologies were different based on 
information provided by the manufacturers, thus leading to different 
results.</P>
<P>The technologies were ranked on a total of ten criteria. Three of these were 
financial, including net present value (NPV), installed cost, and present value 
of savings. One criterion was energy-related, annual site energy savings. The 
remaining criteria were environmental and dealt with reductions in air emissions 
due to fuel or energy savings and included SO<SUB>2</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, CO, 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>, particulate matter and hydrocarbon emissions.</P>
<P>The ranking results from the screening process for this technology are shown 
in Table 2. These values represent the maximum benefit achieved by 
implementation of the technology in every Federal application where it is 
considered life-cycle cost-effective. The actual benefit will be lower because 
full market penetration is unlikely to ever be achieved.</P>

<H3>Laboratory Perspective</H3>
<P>The primary question to be answered is "Does the technology work as 
advertised?" The history of the technologies, as illustrated through primarily 
qualitative--but some quantitative--assessment in many case studies, has shown 
that when properly installed, a decrease in or elimination of scale formation 
will be found. While the evidence supporting the technologies may be thought of 
as mainly anecdotal, the fact remains that upon visual inspection after 
installation of these devices the formation of new scale deposits has been 
inhibited. In addition, in most cases, scale deposits present within the system 
at the time of installation have been removed.</P>
<P>The key here is <I>properly installed</I>. By this it is meant that a 
manufacturer or their qualified representative is responsible for equipment 
integration. Unlike many other technologies where much of the knowledge has been 
reduced to a quantitative model, the non-chemical water treatment industry still 
relies largely on experience as the means of providing quality installation, 
service and, consequently, customer satisfaction. </P>
<P>Of particular interest to the manufacturer would be physical parameters such 
as water flow rate, and water quality parameters such as hardness, alkalinity, 
and iron concentration. These parameters will help determine the optimum size 
and the extent of treatment. </P>
<P>The manufacturer may also want to know whether the installation is for use in 
conjunction with a boiler or a cooling tower, and for once-through or 
recirculating water systems. These parameters will help determine the optimum 
location within the system. </P>
<P>Other factors of interest may include whether the cooling or heating system 
is sensitive to particulate matter, and if so what particle sizes. The device 
works by initiating the precipitation of scale, thus particulate matter will be 
present in the treated water. If the system is sensitive to particulate matter 
there may be a need for a solid separation device such as a filter, a settling 
basin, a cyclone, or a sump to collect solids and to allow for their easy 
removal from the system.

<H2>Application</H2></A>
<P>This section addresses the technical aspects of applying the technology. The 
range of applications and climates in which the technology can be applied are 
addressed. The advantages, limitations, and benefits in each application are 
enumerated. Design and integration considerations for the technology are 
discussed, including equipment and installation costs, installation details, 
maintenance impacts, and relevant codes and standards. Utility incentives and 
support are also discussed.</P>
<H3>Application Screening</H3>
<P>As mentioned previously, the technology can be applied wherever hard water is 
found to cause scale. Since the technology is a physical process, as opposed to 
chemical water softening, it is expected to perform best in locations with 
harder water. In general, only a few locations do not require or would not 
benefit from some type of hardness control. Hard water is one in which the 
hardness is greater than 60&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as calcium carbonate. This 
corresponds to approximately 3.5 grains of hardness per U.S. gallon. The Pacific 
Northwest states, the North Atlantic coastal states, and the Southeast states, 
excluding Florida, are locations where naturally occurring soft water is most 
likely to be found. The balance of the United States could benefit from some 
type of water treatment to control scale formation, using either one of the 
traditional technologies such as lime softening or ion exchange, or the 
non-chemical technology discussed in this FTA.</P>
<H3>Where to Apply</H3>
<P>Non-chemical scale control technologies can be used for either boiler scale 
control or cooling tower scale control. Boiler scale control applications are 
the majority of the installations, but the control of silica scale in cooling 
water applications is also possible. Experience has been cited with both 
retrofit installations and in new installations (see References for a brief 
listing of applicable reports and publications).</P>
<P>Non-chemical scale control technologies are best applied:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>When the use of chemicals for water treatment is to be minimized or 
  eliminated. Lime, salt and acid for cleaning can be reduced or eliminated. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>When space requirements do not allow installation of lime softening 
  equipment or ion exchange equipment. The non-chemical technologies are 
  generally very space efficient. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>When particulate matter in the water can be tolerated by the process; 
  otherwise solids separation is required. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>When frequent system shutdowns are required for descaling even with a 
  diligent chemical scale control program. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>In remote locations where delivery of chemicals and labor cost makes 
  conventional water softening or scale control methods cost 
prohibitive.</LI></UL>
<H3>What to Avoid</H3>
<P>There are a few precautions to be noted before selecting the technology:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>This technology is littered with disreputable manufacturers or vendors, 
  the actions of whom have given the technology an undesirable history in the 
  eyes of many. Work with a reputable manufacturer (such as those included 
  herein) through their engineering department or their designated installer. 
  These people have much more experience with the technology than the typical 
  water treatment engineering firm. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Be aware of process water requirements since these requirements may 
  dictate the need to install solids separation equipment or iron removal 
  equipment in order to maximize the performance of the technology. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Installation near high voltage electrical equipment or strong magnetic 
  fields is to be avoided since these fields will interfere with the performance 
  of the technology. (Near is relative to the voltage; for 208/220/240V it means 
  within 36 inches; for higher voltages it is proportionally more distant.) 
  Also, check the pipeline for its use as an electrical ground. Stray electrical 
  current in the pipe will have the same effect as installation near a strong 
  electrical or magnetic field.</LI></UL>
<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>Installation issues with these devices are few. The first issue is whether a 
permanent magnet or one of the electronic devices is chosen. The latter needs a 
suitable supply of electricity. </P>
<P>The second issue is device capacity, which will dictate space requirements 
and pipe size. The pipe size generally determines the fittings. Smaller devices, 
up to approximately 2" pipe size, are available with solder or pipe thread 
fittings. Larger devices may have flange fittings that would necessitate the 
installation of matching flanges in the current pipe arrangement.</P>
<P>The third issue is the potential for downtime, which needs to be coordinated 
with other facility activities. However, this should not be a major impediment 
since downtime for cleaning and maintenance of cooling towers, or boiler 
inspection is part of the regularly scheduled activities for most 
installations.</P>
<P>A fourth issue would arise with the corrosion control chemistry, which will 
likely need some adjustment under a non-chemical scale control technology. In 
many cases the layer of scale on heat transfer surfaces is beneficial from a 
corrosion control standpoint. With this layer not present when using a 
non-chemical technology, the concentration of corrosion control chemicals may 
need adjustment in order to provide the proper protection. On the reverse side, 
many users are claiming the presence of a fine powdery film on the surfaces the 
treated water contacts. This powder has been attributed to serve as a corrosion 
inhibitor.</P>
<P>The most significant issue may be whether a solids separation device is 
needed to remove the particulates formed. Filters, hydrocyclones, and settling 
basins are all compatible with the technology. The choice among these or other 
solids separation technologies should be made in conjunction with the 
manufacturer who will have the best idea of particle size distribution, and thus 
the relative efficiencies of the separation technologies.</P>
<H3>Maintenance Impact</H3>
<P>There is a significant, positive impact on maintenance. Field applications 
have shown the technology to be capable of controlling scale for extended 
periods of time, months or years, eliminating the periodic cleaning or descaling 
of process equipment that is typical of conventional, </P>
<P>chemical-based scale control technologies. The resources--time, chemicals, 
and equipment--previously devoted to periodic scale removal from heat exchange 
surfaces will be made available for other tasks. Note, however, the need for 
periodic inspection of the heat exchange surfaces is not reduced or 
eliminated.</P>
<P>The electrostatic devices also require periodic inspection of the electrodes. 
This scheduled maintenance activity can be performed in conjunction with the 
heat exchange surface inspection and requires less than a person-day to 
disassemble and inspect the system.</P>
<H3>Equipment Warranties</H3>
<P>All of the manufacturers offer some type of warranty on their respective 
device. The range is from 90&nbsp;days to as much as 10 years. Another 
perspective is the potential impact upon warranties for installed equipment. No 
information was uncovered as part of this effort to indicate any instance where 
a boiler or cooling tower equipment manufacturer voided a warranty for 
equipment. However, no specific effort was made to contact manufacturers of 
boilers and cooling tower equipment to assess specific warranty conditions or 
policies.</P>
<H3>Codes and Standards</H3>
<P>Only one code or standard specific to the non-chemical technologies was 
identified in the course of preparing this FTA: API 960, Evaluation of the 
Principles of Magnetic Water Treatment, 09/1985, 89&nbsp;pages. Of course, all 
applicable plumbing, piping, mechanical, and/or electrical codes and standards 
would still apply.</P>
<H3>Costs</H3>
<P>Cost information was requested from each manufacturer for three 
different-size units, based on flow rate: 1 gpm (gallons per minute), 100 gpm 
and 1,000 gpm. As is typical of process equipment, cost per unit of treatment 
decreases with increasing capacity. To treat 1 gpm, a typical cost was on the 
order of $100, or about $100 per gpm. To treat 1,000 gpm a typical cost was on 
the order of $10,000, or about $10 per gpm.</P>
<P>In general, the electronic units were more costly than the magnetic units for 
an equivalent flow rate. Costs also ranged considerably with unit size, with the 
1-gpm units ranging in cost up to $500. For the 1,000-gpm units the range of 
costs was considerably greater, from $900 to over $1,000,000.</P>
<P>Installation costs also varied widely, in conjunction with equipment size. 
The lower flow rate units will mate with 3/4" to 1" pipe sizes with soldered, 
flanged or threaded (NPT) fittings. Installation time estimates were on the 
order of one hour, with additional parts costing less than $10. The larger-size 
units (1,000 gpm) were typically designed to mate with a 12" to 18" pipe using a 
flange fitting. Estimated installation time ranged from one to four person-days, 
requiring less than $1,000 in additional materials.</P>
<P>Weight was an important characteristic in the installation estimate because 
the permanent magnet units may exceed 1,000 pounds. There is a trade-off between 
installing a heavier permanent magnet unit requiring no outside power versus a 
lighter electronic unit for which an electrical connection needs to be made, and 
possibly electrical lines run to the point of installation. The net effect is 
expected to be neutral with regard to installation time estimates.</P>
<P>Since these units are typically delivered in the sizes quoted off-the-shelf, 
there is no design cost by the manufacturer. Facilities engineering and design 
for calculations and updating plant drawings should amount to less than two 
person-days for the large units, and less than an hour for the small units. 
<H3>Utility Incentives and Support</H3>
<P>Although no specific incentive programs were identified, the Department of 
Energy and the Advanced Research Projects Agency have funded research in this 
area. Some utility or trade associations have supported the electronic 
technologies with funds and exposure. For example, the American Water Works 
Association sponsored a conference to discuss the non-traditional treatment 
technologies. In addition, as California municipalities face water shortages, 
they have turned to a number of measures to lower water consumption and increase 
water quality. Many have prohibited the use of water softeners and may offer 
assistance infunding conversion to low/no salt water conditioning 
technologies.</P>
<H3>Additional Considerations</H3>
<P>There are additional considerations to be taken into account. Primary among 
these is the reduction in chemical use at the facility for water softening. The 
chemical use reduction may lead to reduced safety, training and reporting 
requirements. </P>
<P>Electricity consumption will also be reduced. The actual reduction is highly 
dependent upon the technology employed. Permanent magnets use no electricity, so 
both the on-site electricity used for chemical treatment as well as the off-site 
energy required to produce and transport the chemicals will be eliminated. For 
the electronic units, on-site energy requirements may vary from as little as 10% 
of the chemical-based treatment system energy consumption--typical, to 10 times 
the energy consumed by the chemical-based treatment system.</P>
<P>Energy consumption reductions will lead directly to reductions in air 
combustion emissions. There will also be additional indirect reductions due to 
decreased transportation of fuels and decreased fuel processing. The latter will 
also lead to reductions in water use, water pollution, and solid wastes from 
mining and processing operations.

<H2>Technology Performance</H2></A>
<P>The information in this section was compiled primarily from case studies, 
along with selected contact with users and third party researchers. As mentioned 
previously, the use of magnetic or electric fields to treat water had its 
origins near the turn of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century. Commercialization of the 
technology began after World War II, with the largest advances coming in the 
last 20 years with the development of rare earth magnets and inexpensive 
electronic controls. </P>
<P>There are records of installation of the technology in the United States from 
about 1950. Manufacturers claim to have installations operating satisfactorily 
for as long as 30 years. No good statistics were available on the total number 
of installations over this period. However, using the estimates of one 
manufacturer as a basis, there could be upwards of 1,000,000 units installed in 
the United States in commercial or industrial facilities, inclusive of all units 
installed by all manufacturers.</P>
<H3>Field Experience</H3>
<P>As has been alluded to above, user experience has been positive. Two 
experiences have been common. First, users have noted a dramatic reduction in 
scale formation to the point where the need for chemical scale control is 
eliminated. Second, the prior build-up of scale on heat exchange surfaces has 
been removed over time. This last process has been noted as taking from 30 days 
to over a year, depending upon the thickness and composition of the scale.</P>
<P>This is not to say there have not been less than successful installations or 
applications. The non-chemical technologies may not be universally applicable 
for scale control, just as any technology may not be a universally applicable 
solution to the problem it was designed to solve. </P>
<P>The magnetic technologies are not as effective when silica is present in the 
system. Nor do they work as efficiently when iron is present, as was mentioned 
above, or when other magnetic minerals are present. The history of the 
technology is also littered with cases where the magnet field was applied 
incorrectly or did not have sufficient strength to affect the reaction. This 
latter was especially true early in the life cycle of the technology when 
ferrous-based magnets were the norm. High levels of particulate matter will also 
negatively influence the efficiency of the technology by reducing the collision 
frequency of the desirable reactions.</P>
<H3>Energy Savings</H3>
<P>Energy savings result from both reductions in pumping energy input to the 
system and reduction in fuel consumption. The first aspect has not been well 
quantified by the users or in any of the case studies. It is thought of as a 
secondary benefit.</P>
<P>Fuel consumption has been lowered in every situation. The exact savings are a 
result of a number of factors:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>How effective the chemical scale control program may have been relative to 
  the input water hardness 
  <P></P>
  <LI>How often the heat exchange system was taken down for maintenance and 
  cleaning.</LI></UL>
<P>On systems that were descaled frequently or had low scale formation, due to 
low hardness and/or an effective chemical scale control program, the savings in 
fuel consumption was lower, often from a few percent to as much as 15%. The 
lower savings were at an installation using ion exchange softening of moderately 
hard water (less than 150 mg/L as calcium carbonate hardness). On systems where 
descaling was infrequent or absent altogether, or where the chemical scale 
control program was not as effective in controlling scale formation, fuel 
consumption savings ranged up to 30%. This was found to be the case in an 
installation using very hard water (hardness in excess of 300 mg/L as calcium 
carbonate), andd a chemical scale control program, with heat exchanger tubes 
closing due to scale formation after less than one year. In each case the fuel 
consumption savings was proportional to the thickness of the scale layer 
removed. </P>
<P>One important note was that fuel consumption savings often trailed 
installation of the technology by a significant period due to the fact that the 
savings is driven by the amount of scale on the heat exchange surface. The 
accumulated scale will erode over time, resulting in fuel consumption 
reductions. For this reason, many of the manufacturers recommend installing the 
technology only after the system has been descaled, thus savings in fuel 
consumption would be immediate.</P>
<H3>Maintenance</H3>
<P>As mentioned above, maintenance requirements typically are reduced upon 
implementation of the non-chemical technology. First, periodic maintenance of 
the water-softening equipment and chemicals is eliminated. Second, the periodic 
heat exchanger inspection and cleaning cycle is reduced to an inspection cycle. 
The handling and storage requirements for the chemicals--lime, soda ash, salt 
and acid--have been eliminated, as has training for their use, storage and 
handling. The reduction in these periodic activities frees up the previously 
time allocated for application to other activities.</P>
<P>There are maintenance activities associated with this technology. For the 
electromagnetic and electrostatic units, a daily check that the power is on is 
necessary (a "power on" indicator light is included with most, if not all, 
units). The electrostatic units need to have the electrodes checked 
periodically, semi-annually, and the electrodes replaced when noticeably worn or 
damaged, perhaps every five years. The reader should speak to the manufacturer 
for details which may vary.</P>
<P>When solids or particulates accumulate in the system, they will need to be 
removed. Automatic blowdown of the system should control the daily accumulation. 
If the system is not cleaned prior to installation of the non-chemical 
technology, the scale in the system will detach and its removal will be 
necessary. Filters, sumps and hydrocyclones are all effective means of capturing 
the solids, but each will require periodic cleaning.</P>
<H3>Environmental Impacts</H3>
<P>There are areas where the technology mitigates environmental impacts. The 
first is air quality due to emissions reduction associated with decreases in 
fuel consumption. The second is a corresponding decrease in solid wastes, ash 
and other fuel combustion residues to be disposed. Of course, this will only be 
applicable in the situation in which an end user combusts fuels on-site for the 
production of power. A third area is the reduction in release, or potential for 
release, of water treatment chemicals stored at a facility. Since chemical 
consumption will decrease, emissions from storage will also decrease. The wastes 
associated with disposal and management of used chemical containers will also be 
reduced.

<A name=case></a>
<H2>Case Study</H2>
<P>For the case study, a hypothetical facility is used and the application of a 
permanent magnet device is described. The conditions are based on information 
gathered during the user interviews and reading of published and unpublished 
case studies. The purpose is to illustrate the types of data required to prepare 
a site-specific cost analysis, not to illustrate what any particular user might 
experience in the way of cost savings.</P>
<H3>Facility Description</H3>
<P>The facility currently uses extremely hard water (hardness of 350 mg/L as 
calcium carbonate) and employs lime softening. The process water is used in a 
recirculating boiler water system with flow of 1,000 gpm or 1.4 MGD (million 
gallons per day). Makeup and blowdown were estimated at 10% of the flow, or 
140,000 gallons per day. The water-softening process removes a significant 
fraction of the hardness, but not all, leading to semiannual inspections and 
annual cleaning of the heat exchanger. This frequency is thought to be fairly 
typical.</P>
<P>Cost for the lime used in the process is estimated at $10/ton delivered. Cost 
for natural gas is $5.80/1000 ft<SUP>3</SUP>. Acetic acid, used for cleaning, 
costs $2 per gallon.</P>
<H3>Existing Technology Description</H3>
<P>The current system is a conventional lime softening plant consisting of lime 
storage facilities, a slaker where the powered lime is mixed with water, a 
mixing basin for adding controlled amounts of the lime solution to the water, 
and a settling basin where the precipitated solids are removed. Downstream of 
the water treatment facilities is a conventional shell-and-tube heat exchanger 
used to heat the water for both building heat and process water. </P>
<P>Lime consumption for softening is 48 tons/year. In this case, alkalinity is 
sufficient so as to not require the addition of soda ash during the softening 
process. Natural gas consumption for process water heating is 400,000 MBtu/year. 
Electricity consumption for the softening process was estimated at 3,100 kWh per 
year. Acetic acid is used during cleaning, approximately 100 gallons per 
cleaning. Production losses due to system downtime are not being included in 
this analysis.</P>
<P>(If the system had instead used ion exchange softening, the applicable 
chemical use information would have been the regenerant, typically salt but 
possibly acid, and the consumption of ion exchange resin. This last item is 
calculated as the mass replaced divided by the total volume of water 
treated.)</P>
<P>Data on lime consumption can typically be found in purchasing records, or 
also in a water treatment system operator's log. The latter would be more 
accurate since it would more closely reflect lime used for water softening, 
whereas the former would list only lime purchases including those for water 
softening, pH adjustment and other uses. </P>
<P>Natural gas consumption, or other fuel consumption data, can be taken from 
accounting records, if the only use of natural gas is for process water, or from 
operation data, (e.g., firing rate data), or calculated from an energy balance 
for a portion of the production system. The firing rate data or other operation 
data would be the most accurate but might not always be available.</P>
<P>Electricity consumption information can be calculated from nameplate capacity 
of the mixing and pumping equipment involved. For this report, it was derived 
from information compiled by the Electric Power Research Institute. In some 
cases there may be energy or monitoring data available for the process that 
would be available as part of the water treatment system operator's records.</P>
<H3>New Technology Equipment Selection</H3>
<P>A magnetic scale control device will be investigated as an alternative to 
chemical scale control. The first step was consultation with the manufacturer, 
including submitting water analysis data and a schematic of the current system 
showing the proposed location of the equipment to facilitate manufacturer 
selection and equipment sizing. (A magnetic device was chosen because the 
preferred installation location was remote, with electrical power not readily 
available.)</P>
<P>For the proposed location and required flow rate, a unit was identified that 
would fit the current piping configuration without a need for adapters. The unit 
cost is $10,000 including shipping. The estimate by the in-house facilities 
engineering staff calls for three days to install the system, one-half day each 
for set-up and clean-up, one day to remove a section of pipe to make space for 
the device (including installing flanges), and one day for installation and leak 
testing. Three people are required, as well as a device capable of lifting 1,000 
pounds in order to position the device and facilitate removal of the old section 
of pipe.</P>
<P>One of the key elements to sizing these devices is the water velocity through 
the device. Manufacturers recommend, typically, at least a 7 feet per second 
water velocity. If the water velocity through a section of pipe is too low, it 
will be necessary to use adapters to decrease the size of the pipe through the 
device, thus increasing the velocity. Water velocity in feet per second can be 
calculated as follows, where <I>Diameter</I> is in feet:</P>
<CENTER>
  <P><IMG height=36 
src="11_equation.gif" 
width=124> 
</CENTER>
<P>Savings are expected to result from discontinuance of chemical consumption 
and decreased energy consumption (10% of process energy and all of the water 
treatment energy). Inspection will still occur. </P>
<H3>Savings Potential</H3>
<P>Energy savings can result from two areas. First is the reduction in fuel used 
in generating heat. Methods for calculating the fuel consumption were discussed 
above in the technology descriptions. The fuel consumption savings is simply the 
net difference, in this case estimated equal to 10% of the baseline fuel 
consumption. (This estimated savings was used to illustrate a case where there 
was a fairly uniform 1/16" thick layer of scale across a heat exchanger surface. 
Of course, it is realized that the scale layer, and therefore energy 
consumption, builds over time and is not an instantaneous effect.) This savings 
is also equal to the loss in heat transfer efficiency due to scale formation on 
the heat exchange surface.</P>
<P>Second is the energy savings resulting from decreased pressure drop within 
the heat exchanger. This is not quantified here, but could be quantified if the 
pressure drop through the current system was known, along with the energy 
characteristics of the pump so that reductions in pressure could be related to 
energy consumption.</P>
<P>Cost savings also result from reductions in chemical use. Chemical softening 
will be reduced, and likely eliminated, by the use of non-chemical treatment 
technologies. There will also be a corresponding energy decrease from the 
shutdown of chemical mixing equipment and water treatment equipment used in the 
softening process. The estimated chemical savings here was 480 tons per year and 
the corresponding electricity savings was 31,000 kWh per year.</P>
<P>Table 3 illustrates typical consumption data for the baseline and alternative 
and the potential annual costs savings. Not shown are water consumption and 
water discharge, which do not change between the alternatives. Capital cost for 
the alternative treatment system, estimated at $10,000 at the beginning of the 
15-year analysis period, is not shown either. Fifteen years was chosen because 
it was typical of the life of field units.</P>

<H3>Life-Cycle Cost</H3>
<P>The full results of the BLCC computations are shown in Appendix B. A 
discussion of the BLCC software is given in Appendix A. The BLCC Comparative 
Economic Analysis is shown in Figure 5. Installation cost for the magnetic 
treatment device is estimated at $10,360, calculated as $10,000 for the device 
and $360 for design and installation labor. Operating costs for the technology 
are estimated at $2,088,000 per year versus costs of $2,320,635 per year for the 
conventional lime-softening technology, both exclusive of water consumption and 
discharge. Life-cycle costs for each of the technologies as calculated by the 
BLCC software are $27,524,500 for the magnetic technology versus $30,283,500 for 
the conventional technology. (This includes the cost of water and wastewater 
disposal of $2,605,292.) This represents a life-cycle cost savings of 
$2,759,000. The Simple Payback from BLCC is less than one year, and the Adjusted 
Internal Rate of Return is 50.66%.</P>

<H2>The Technology in Perspective</H2></A>
<P>The future of non-chemical water treatment technologies is promising. As 
public awareness of the environmental effects of chemicals increases there will 
be an increasing demand to deploy alternative, more environmentally beneficial 
technologies. As a means of reducing energy consumption and stretching the 
available personnel resources in the days of ever-shrinking budgets, 
non-chemical technologies make sense as both cost effective and having 
demonstrated performance.</P>
<H3>The Technology's Development</H3>
<P>Magnetic and electrical effects on water were first noticed prior to the turn 
of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century. Considerable research is being conducted on 
magnetohydrodynamics by the Japanese as a means of propulsion, and similar 
research has been conducted in the past in the United States and other 
industrialized countries. This research has been facilitated by the advent of 
rare earth magnets, solid state electronics, and advanced ceramic or polymeric 
materials after World War II. Only after these advances has non-chemical water 
treatment shown promise and come into more widespread use.</P>
<P>Of the manufacturers listed in this FTA most have come into existence since 
the advent of the environmental movement in the United States in the early 
1970s. This can be attributed both to the advent of cost-effective components 
(e.g., magnets, electronics) and to the public desire for more "green" or 
environmentally friendly alternatives to chemical treatment.</P>
<H3>Relation to Other Technologies</H3>
<P>The use of the non-chemical technologies does not prohibit the use of any 
other technology or equipment. As was mentioned previously, the change from 
chemical to non-chemical scale control may warrant investigation of other means 
of corrosion or biofouling control, as these three chemical scale treatment or 
control strategies or applications are often balanced amongst each other.</P>
<P>An increase in cycles of concentration was also noted by one user as another 
water saving measure that was employed. The ability to increase the cycles of 
concentration was attributed to the stability of scale-forming ions or scale 
particles in suspension. Water consumption was halved in this multi-pass 
system.</P>
<H3>Technology Outlook</H3>
<P>There is no basis to assume that the technologies are going to disappear 
anytime soon. Each has a historical basis of successful installations. Advances 
in materials science should only serve to improve each of the technologies. More 
powerful magnets will allow the magnetic devices to become smaller and/or more 
efficacious. More durable electrodes and dielectric compounds will improve the 
life of the electrostatic units.</P>
<P>Probably the most significant trend is the move away from chemical treatment 
technologies. This trend has begun at the consumer level, is becoming apparent 
at the corporate level, and will continue to grow. Increased availability of 
information on the technologies, the environment, and human health will only 
serve to feed this trend.

<P>Included here are but a few of the installations provided by the 
manufacturers. For a full listing the reader is advised to contact a 
manufacturer directly. Some manufacturers expressed concern about printing 
customer names in a public list such as this Federal Technology Alert but 
indicated they could provide such customer references to interested potential 
buyers. Most manufacturers specify having hundreds to almost 10,000 
installations. Not all of these sites were contacted during the course of 
preparing this FTA.</P>

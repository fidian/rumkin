!Painful Insult
If you win, this show is an absolute failure.  [Insult]
I think, based on that performance, if you were to win the competition, \
it would be a disaster.  [Insult]
I can't believe that it happened again.  [Karaoke]
This was the worst I have heard throughout the entire competition

[Setup Bad]
I could only describe your voice as [Adj Bad].
Very, very dissapointing.
God, I thought that was absolutely [Adj Bad].
How did you make it this far?
[Shout]
[Looks]
[Karaoke]
I think you just killed my favorite song of all time.
That was [Adj Bad].  I mean [Adj Bad].
There are only so many words in my vocabulary that I can drag out to \
say how [Adj Bad] that was.

!Average
I don't think that the song matches your personality.
Your performance was good-ish.
That was not your best.
I didn't feel enough emotion in your song.
While I saw that as good, I don't see that as a winning performance.
This was an average performance.
I don't think that performance merits you to be proclaimed American Idol.
[Thin Line]  I didn't know where you were going with the song.

[Setup Good]
We went from good to sensational.
I think that this was so much better than what you did before.
I think you've just raised the game, haven't you?
You look great.
Hands-down.  Amazing.
I think you've proved you are a star.
You did terriffic tonight.  And the great thing was that we were seeing \
you as you.
Ok, I admit it.  I've got a crush.

[Find A Star] and you are a star.
[America Is Known]  And you are one of them.
[Fantastic Performance]  And you\'re one of them.

!Setup Bad
[Bad Audition]  And it kept getting worse.
[Top Ten]  And you shouldn't be.
[Great Voice]  Americal Idol?  No.
It was good.  [However Bad]  [Insult]
[Find A Star] and you are not a star.
[Find A Star] and you are good.  Good, but not necessarily good enough.

!Fantastic Performance
We've had so many absolutely fantastic performances.

!America Is Known
America is not known for nice singers, it is known for great singers.

!Bad Audition
I just think that it was a bad audition.

!Find A Star
This competition is about finding a star,
Look, the competition is about finding a star,

!Top Ten
There are people in this room who should not be in the top ten, and there \
are people in this room who should be in the top ten.

!Shout
You shouted the song.
There is a difference between shouting and singing.  You need to learn it.

!Thin Line
I think there's a thin line between cool and boring.

!However Good
However, you've worked hard and it shows.

!However Bad
However, we have to pass judgement based on the other competetors.
However, you've been outperformed by others tonight.

!Karaoke
This was karaoke once again.
You sounded like Brazilian karaoke.
You had a karaoke performance.

!Great Voice
I think you have a great voice.

!Looks
You don't look like the American Idol.
You need to become what the American Idol looks like.
Your voice is not the only thing that needs improvement.

!Support
If the American public doesn't vote for you, I'd be [Emotion Bad].
I hope you go on.
I really really hope you do well in this competition because it just \
proves the point that nice people can be pop stars as well.'

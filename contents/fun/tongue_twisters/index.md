title: Tongue Twisters
template: index.jade

Tongue twisters are fun little exercises for your mouth.  They often use alliteration (the repeating of the beginning sounds of words) and rhyme in order to force you to verbally "stumble" instead of speaking clearly.  The mistake will usually produce a smile in those listening to your attempt.

If you know of a tongue twister that you would like to see listed on these pages, please send it to me.  I would love to hear about it.

King Boreas' Hall of Fame
-------------------------

Last Updated: June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2006 with number 194

[King Boreas] has a [scoreboard] that lists people who have helped him out with his various [geocaches].  He modeled it after the[9Key Hall of Fame], but he didn't have that cool image thing at the bottom, so I decided to see if I could write something similar without using any images.  If anyone wants to use this, feel free!  ([Licensing info])

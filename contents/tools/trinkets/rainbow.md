Enter in anything that you want converted into a rainbow.  It will gently fade from letter to letter.  Then, you can copy the generated HTML into your web page.

<input type="text" class="input">

This is the result:

<p><b class="show outline"></b></p>

And here's the HTML in case you like what you see:

<div class="showText outline"></div>

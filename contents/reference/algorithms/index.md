This page is devoted to the various algorithms that I have collected over the years.  Here, you will find a description of the algorithm, what it is used for, links to code that I wrote and related off-site links.  I like to keep things organized, so pick your favorite topic below:

### [Doubly-Linked List](linked_list/)

Interesting idea (backed with code) about how you can save memory by using XOR to store the difference between the previous and next nodes in the list.

### [Fuzzy String Matching](fuzzy_strings/)

How to determine the degree of similarity for two different strings.  I cover Levenshtein's and Oliver's methods along with soundex.

### [String Escaping](escaping/)

Discussion on the topic of properly escaping strings when converting from one language or system to another.  Some code examples are included.

This is a collection of little tidbits regarding web development.  They come from many years of coding, so some examples are quite dated.  I hope that you find some useful stuff here.

* [Favorite Icon](favicon/) - A shortcut icon or favicon is a little image that shows up in the address bar of your browser.  Here is how to include them.

* [Include JavaScript On Demand](include_javascript/) - If you have the desire to load JavaScript files dynamically and even know when they have loaded, this page is for you!

* [Speedier JavaScript](javascript_speed/) - If you code it right and use these tips, your program will eek out the last drop of speed from the browser.

* [Popup Window Communication](popup_window/) - How to open a popup window and pass data back and forth with JavaScript.

* [Transparency with CSS](transparency/) - How to fade elements in and out.  Complete with a live example and tips to avoid flickers in the browser.

* [Lifegenesis](lifegenesis/) - Conway's game of cellular automata, animated by using JavaScript to swap CSS classes.  Random splatters assist in keeping things interesting.

* [Image Mouseover](image_mouseover/) - Swapping images with a mouseover.  This also displays textual descriptions and can put a message in the status bar.

* [Onload Overloading](onload/) - When you have multiple JavaScript programs that both want to start with `window.onload`?  Alter them both accordingly so that they will never conflict again.  Code this way for all of your `window.onload` needs and remove potential sources of trouble.

* [Geographic Navigation](geonav/) - By using a spinning globe, you can separate the information you have about the world into groups by continent.  Spinning globe is provided by JavaScript and a series of images.

<dt>Game Information</dt>
<dd>Greatsword +3  (2d6+3, 19-20/x2)</dd>
<dd>Entirely composed of enchanted ice with no discomfort to the wielder.
The sword does not have the capability to freeze water if the sword is plunged
into, for example, a lake.  However, it may make the room seem a bit 
chilly.</dd>
<dd>Constantly steams and drips.  Magical recondensation rebuilds it.
Cannot be sheathed, unless the sheath allows for the dripping and constant
steam.  If a shard breaks off the sword, the material will be recreated from
the moisture in the air.</dd>
<dd>Killing strokes freeze opponents solid.  Any touch as a 50% chance to
shatter the body.  Shattering an opponent splinters the body so much as to
negate a <i>raise dead</i> spell.
<dt>Shards</dt>
<dd>On a critical hit, a shard breaks off in a wound and transfers points to
the weilder.  Roll 1d4 to determine what is transferred.</dd>
<dd>1 - Transfers 1 hp/round to wielder</dd>
<dd>2 - Steals 3 hp/round, sends to wielder</dd>
<dd>3 - Transfers 1 strength point / 2 rounds; wielder obtains a maximum of 24
strength</dd>
<dd>4 - Transfers 1 level or HD on first embedding.  If still lodged after 10
rounds, 50% chance to drain one more level before melting.</dd>
<dd>Undead and nonliving are immune to the shards.</dd>
<dd>Can exceed normal HP, Str, Level with stolen points.  Stolen strength and
level benefits fade after 30 minutes.  Excess hit points (above your normal 
amount) fade after 30 minutes.</dd>
<dd>Victims regain HP and Strength at the rate of 1 per turn.  Level loss is 
permanent.<br>
<dd>Victim can take a full round action to remove one shard.  Victim must
make a successful Fortitude save, DC 20, in order to find and remove the
shard.</dd>
<dd>Upon removal or 10 rounds, whatever comes first, the shard melts.  The
melting is unpreventable -- even a <i>wish</i> merely suspends the melting
for 1d10 rounds.  However, there is a 1% chance that the shard won't melt
and instead will act as an icy dagger +2 (Frostblade).</dd>
<dt>Further Information</dt>
<dd>Artifact - This sword was created to be a <u>weapon of power</u>, one
of four such weapons:  Frostrazor, Blackrazor, XXX(hammer), XXX(trident).  
The other three are intelligent, but nobody is sure
about this one.  If it is intelligent, it has not made itself known and it
is also immune to probing techniques (spells, psionics, etc.) to sense if 
the sword is intelligent.</dd>
<dd>XP Value:  8,000 (somewhat low)</dd>

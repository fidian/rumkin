This is a crazy wild show.
The competition is getting tougher.
It's a tough job to sing and make it your own.

I liked it.
Very [Good Adj] job.
You sound [Good Adj].
I thought that it was [Good Adj].
I love the way you do things.  You never over-do it.
I think that this is your best performance yet.
You seem more confident.
I thought that this was a [Good Adj] choice of song for you.

I think you could be exactly what the American Idol is all about.
Great.  Brilliant.
You know you look beautiful.
I've heard you sing better, but it was still a [Good Adj] job.
You know I love you.
[Quip]  I'm just so speechless and happy for you!
What a [Good Adj] song for such a great singer.
I didn't know you had all of that.  [Loved]
You are exactly singing, performing, dressing, acting, everything what I \
think the American Idol competition should be.

That was not really [Good Adj] at all.  That was really bad.
I didn't think that was very [Good Adj] tonight.
I didn't [Feeling] that.
Vocally, you were a little missing for me tonight.
It was a little [Music] [Time].
I think we're going to see a lot better tonight.
[Good Adj] song, but ... I don't know.
The song that you chose did not fit your [Thing].
I don't [Mind] if this was one of your best performances.

Bored at work?  Killing time between classes?  I've got just the thing.  Most of these games require Adobe Flash unless otherwise noted.


### [Adrenaline Challenge](adrenaline.swf)

Ride your motorcycle to collect the green dots and make it to the exit.


### [Asteroids](neave_asteroids.swf)

One of the first arcade games.  Who needs color?  We only need three lines to display an entire starship!


### [Break It](breakit.swf)

You use your paddle to bounce a ball in order to break bricks.  The game goes by several names, but this version has some neat effects to keep it interesting.


### [D-Fence](d-fence.swf)

Protect your fort by shooting the invaders.


### [Flashzooids](flashiness_fz.swf)

This is a much prettier version of asteroids.


### [Freecell (Java)](freecell/)

Fun solitare-style card game.


### [Helicopter Game](helicopter.swf)

Fly your helicopter through a tunnel and avoid the obstacles.


### [Hexxagon](neave_hexxagon.swf)

Othello-like game where you can choose to either clone a piece to another cell or jump to a more distant cell.  Nearby opponent pieces are then changed into your pieces ... then the computer gets to go.  Great strategy board game.


### [Kitten Cannon](kitten_cannon.swf)

If you really don't like cats, then this game is for you.  If you don't want to see helpless kittens become mangled in a cartoon style, then avoid this game.


### [Pacman](pacman.swf)

A Flash version of the original arcade game.


### [Penguin Baseball](penguin_baseball.swf)

A fun game of timing.  How far can you whack the penguin?


### [Raiden X](raiden_x.swf)

Fly your ship around and blow up the bad guys.


### Stick Man Sam

You play Sam, a stick man action hero.  Run around, jump, and use your mouse to shoot things.  Lots of fun!  This game comes in multiple installments:

* [Stick Man Sam 1](stickmansam1.swf)
* [Stick Man Sam 2](stickmansam2.swf)
* [Stick Man Sam 3](stickmansam3.swf)
* [Stick Man Sam 4](stickmansam4.swf)


### [Territory War](territory_war.swf)

Play against another person or the computer and see who can conquer the enemy first.


### [Tetris](neave_tetris.swf)

This game is provided for all of you die-hard Tetris fans out there.

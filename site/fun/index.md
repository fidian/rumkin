title: Fun Stuff
---

I keep a smattering of entertaining things on my site.  Not much, but perhaps something here can brighten your day.


[Fortune Cookie](fortune-cookie/)
---------------------------------

Did you just eat a meal and now you need a fortune?  I collect mine and randomly give them back out to website visitors.


[Games](games/)
---------------

These games range from Asteroids and Pacman to Stick Man Sam and Raiden X.  Fun things that I have found and put on my site.  I didn't write any of them, but they are here for others to use.  Almost all use Adobe Flash, just in case that matters.


[Tongue Twisters](tongue-twisters/)
-----------------------------------

A large collection of phrases and verses that are challenging to properly say.  A great way to work our your mouth muscles.

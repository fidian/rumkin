title: Fun Stuff
---

I keep a smattering of entertaining things on my site.  Not much, but perhaps something here can brighten your day.


[Fortune Cookie](fortune-cookie/)
---------------------------------

Did you just eat a meal and now you need a fortune?  I collect mine and randomly give them back out to website visitors.


[Personality Tests](tests/)
---------------------------

Probably mostly meaningless, but entertaining. You won't need to enter your email address or register to get the results because that would be silly.


[Tongue Twisters](tongue-twisters/)
-----------------------------------

A large collection of phrases and verses that are challenging to properly say.  A great way to work our your mouth muscles.

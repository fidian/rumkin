I collect fortune cookie sayings whenever I find them.  Here's one that has been picked just for you.

{{! Approximate size is 2.25" x 0.625".  That means W = 3.6 * H. }}

<div class="H(4em) W(14.4em) Bgc(#fff) Ta(c) D(tb) Fz(1.4em) Py(0) Px(0.5em) Mx(a) fortuneCookieBackground"><span class="D(tbc) Va(m) Lh(1.1em) Fz(0.8em)" random-line="'fortunes.txt'" contenteditable="true"></span></div>

Reload for a new fortune.  If you would prefer, you are allowed to just change the fortune cookie yourself.  It's editable.  Click on the fortune cookie and start typing!

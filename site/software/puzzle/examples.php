<P>You think that the puzzle is just a toy? Good! The people who put up the
following pages also think so. If you would like your link added/deleted,
please feel free to e-mail me about it. My email address is displayed at the
bottom of these web pages. Also, please send me links of <B>any</B> site
that uses my applet. I just would like to keep track of how it spreads and 
be able to notify the site owners of updates to the puzzle. (How rare
<b><i>that</i></b> is!)</P>

This is the net.book.riddles.  It is the work of myself in
the collection of all of the riddles which have been
submitted to myself via e-mail and rec.games.frp.  I hope
you enjoy it.

Please note that for MANY of these riddles, those who
submitted them do NOT take credit for their creation.  These
are just those people who submitted the riddles - NOT THE
Authors.  There are some though, which are the creation of
the people submitting them.  If possible, this has been
marked.  Those not marked though, are the work of some other
Author unknown to myself or not specified when the riddle
was given to me.

Thanks to everyone who submitted riddles whether from books
or from their own head.  This is a lengthy list, so I hope
everyone will bear with me in this listing.  Thanks again
everyone!

The format of these entries has been revamped to provide
more information about each of the submitters.  The form has
been changed to the following:

Entry:  Entry number of the riddle as submitted to myself.
Date:   The date the riddle was submitted.
Who:    Who submitted the riddle
Author: The actual Author of the riddle (if different)
Title:  <If any>
Riddle: The riddle itself.

At the bottom of the list will be the answers.  The answers
are listed in the order of preference.  Thus, the most
preferred answer will be placed first with additional
answers (if any) following.  All answers are based upon the
"Entry" field.  The entry field works in the following way:

1.  When you submit a riddle you are assigned a unique
    number (1-inf).
2.  The ID number will be the first part of the number.
3.  The second part of the number (after the period) is the
    number assigned to the riddle.

Ex:

Entry:  1.1
Date:   <Unknown>
Who:    cpearce@morticia.cnns.unt.edu
Author: Unknown
Title:  None
Riddle:

    You eat something....

4.  As you can see, the "1.1" is by the entry field.  The
    first "1" means C. Pearce is the first person in the list.
    The second "1" means this is his first riddle given to me.
    His second would be labeled "1.2" and so on.  The answers
    are matched the same way.

I hope you enjoy the net.book.riddles and any (constructive)
suggestions are welcome and appreciated.  Thanks to everyone
who has posted any kind of a riddle to the Usenet.  I will
make all additional entries on an "As Time Allows" basis
(Which might be never again - ya just don't know).

Notes:

Please send any and all updates and/or corrections to
mark@pokey.jsc.nasa.gov. If you can't get me there, then
simply post it.  I should see it and will try to get in
touch with you instead.  Thanks again.

PS:If, on something which reads "Unknown", you know what
should go in that location - then please DO drop me a note.
None of these riddles are meant to be rip offs from someone
else's work.  I just thought I'd compile a list of riddles
and look what's happened!  :-)

Disclaimer:  I hereby throw this into the public domain.  I
take no responsibility for this book's merits, worth, or
anything else.  However, although ***THIS*** work is now in
the public domain arena that does NOT mean the works contained
within it are.  All of the individual authors (myself
included) would be highly upset if a new computer game came
out with our riddles in it without being paid some kind of a
nominal fee.  Nor would an anthology or other book
containing these riddles be welcome without recourse to
being reimbursed for our time and efforts.  Therefore!  You
can use these riddles however you see fit - so long as you
don't make any kind of a profit from them.  If you decide
you'd like to try to make money in some way through the use
of these riddles - then you should seek the agreement of the
individual authors.  That's why I've included who they are -
so you can find them. Nuff said (I think).

   They all stay together and do double time.
   I count them up, ten times or more,
   And race on-off, across the floor.

    Bound by age, comfort and zest,
    The inquiring hand could not rest.
    But given to her heart's desire,
    She gave to us - our worst quagmires.
    And so now we wallow in our grief,
    And seeking to close the box we weep.
    While famine, plague, and other woes,
    Beset ourselves - and our foes.

    Hey! Dilly, dill, dang, dang!
    "Hi! Ho!" away he'd go!
    Off to see the girls.
    To laugh and sing and play his games,
    Until he went insane!

    Oh what can it be that's this much fun?

    A lazy day looked down upon her,
    And with eyes barely slitted, she saw me.
    I wondered if I should wander.
    But drew back when her eyes grew the bigger.
    Satisfied of my cowering, she stretched,
    Yawned, and spread her fingers langorously.
    And I, with my petite fingers rubbed my nose as I watched.
    She knew I had to eat and that soon I would emerge.
    Drawing my darkness forth with me to escape notice.
    It would not matter, for in the end we would
    Perform our pagan dance.  With its rituals of sunlight,
    And shadow.  Of words, softly spoken - or sprayed upon the wall.
    If I am lucky, oh so lucky, I will whisk away
    Upon a squeal of delight - or is it pain?
    And ponder the world once more, from within
    The hovel, the crawl space, the cracks.

    When, mayhap, she was away.

    Not knowing that his time has passed,
    And that that, which gave him his reason for living,
    His roots,
    Were no longer his own.
    But blackened stumps,
    Against which no living being could hope to live.
    yet...
    In his passing, life found purchase.
    For other creatures, making use of that which would remain,
    Would, in of themselves, find life.
    While the giant slept,
    Upon the rocks.

    I heard of an invading, vanquishing army
    sweeping across the land, liquid-quick;
    conquering everything, quelling resistance.
    With it came darkness, dimming the light.
    Humans hid in their houses, while outside
    spears pierced, shattering stone walls.
    Uncountable soldiers smashed into the ground,
    but each elicited life as he died;
    when the army had vanished, advancing northward,
    the land was green and growing, refreshed.

Riddle:

		(more of a regular brain-teaser)
		
		Old King Ghorn had forged his kingdom from the war-wracked
		lands of Arndor not by the strength of his sword but by the
		sharpness of mind. It was his cleverness that tricked the
		goblins into leaving; it was trickiness that made the dragon
		wing to better hunting grounds; it was his wisdom that kept
		the barons from feuding amongst themselves and the horsemen
		from attacking. Peace had reigned in Ghornia for 35 years,
		and the king's sword became rusty as he raised his family.
		Alas, the old king was on his deathbed before he could sire
		any sons; his only heir was his daughter Triella. Now Good
		King Ghorn knew that for peace to continue in Ghornia the
		next king would have to be as clever, and so he devised the
		following test for his daughter's suitors. He who could pass
		it would become king; all others would die.

		The test was thus:
		The princess was put in the center of a huge 50 foot by 50
		foot carpet. Whomsoever could touch her hand would get the
		princess, and the throne besides. However, the rules of the
		test were that the contestants could not walk over the
		carpet, cross the plane of the carpet, or hang from
		anything; nor could they use anything but their body and
		wits (i.e. no magic or psionics, nor any items such as
		ladders, block and tackles etc). Furthermore, only normal
		humans could be applicants (i.e. no deformed guys with 50
		foot arms, or shapechangers).

		Ghornia now stands; it has a king whose wisdom is
		unsurpassed. How did the king touch Triella's hand?

		Wounded I am, and weary with fighting;
		Gashed by iron, gored by the point of it,
		Sick of battle-work, battered and scarred.
		Many a fearful fight have I seen, when
		Hope there was none, or helping the thick of it,
		Ere I was down and fordone in the fray.
		Offspring of hammers, hardest of battle-blades,
		Smithied in forges, fell on me savagely,
		Doomed to bear the brunt and shock of it,
		Fierce encounter of clashing foes,
		Leech cannot heal my hurts with his simples,
		Salves and sores have I sought in vain.
		Blade cuts dolorous, deep in the side of me,
		Daily and nightly redouble my wounds.

		I war with the wind, with the waves I wrestle;
		I must battle with both when the bottom I seek,
		My strange habitation by surges o'er-roofed.
		I am strong in strife, while I still remain;
		As soon as I stir, they are stronger than I.
		They wrench and they wrest, till I run from my foes;
		What was put in my keeping they carry away.
		If my back be not broken, I baffle them still;
		The rocks are my helpers, when hard I am pressed;
		Grimly I grip them.  Guess what I'm called.

		My beak is below, I burrow and nose
		Under the ground, I go as I'm guided
		By my master the farmer, old foe of the forest;
		Bent and bowed, and my back he walks,
		Forward pushing me over the field;
		Sows on my path where I've passed along.
		I come from the wood, a wagon carried me;
		I was fitted with skill, I am full of wonders.
		As grubbing I go, there's green on one side,
		But black on the other my path is seen.
		A curious prong pierces my back;
		Beneath me in front, another grows down
		And forward pointing is fixed to my head.
		I tear and gash the ground with my teeth,
		If my master steer me with skill from behind.

		A very stout beak, a steeple neck
		And a home above men.  Harsh are my sufferings
		When that which makes the forest tremble takes and shakes me.
		Here I stand under steaming rain
		And blinding sleet, stoned by hail;
		Freezes the frost and falls the snow
		On me stuck-bellied.  And I stick it all out
		For I cannot change the change that made me.

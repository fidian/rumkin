Local Awesomeness
-----------------

These links are more for reference with the group that plays at my house.

* [Character Sheets](char-sheet/) - These are the best ones I could find.

* [Guenever's House Rules](house-rules/) - These are the additional modifications that we have made to 3rd Edition D&D.  This also covers odd situational rulings.

* [Extra Classes](classes/) - Prestige classes that your characters can use.

* [Die Roller Stats](../../tools/die-stats/) - Visually see the difference between 3d6 and 4d4+2.  Plus get some good math stats too.

* [Items](items/) - Magic items we came across in our adventures.  Just a tiny amount of the unique ones.  This online reference is more for remembering the adventures than as a good collection of things.

Also, maybe you would be interested in what I've tried to [make a large whiteboard](../whiteboard/) as a table coating so we simply draw maps and play on a huge grid.


Rules
-----

* [Pathfinder](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG) - An open gaming system based on WotC's d20 open gaming system.  You can layer this on top of your existing 3.5 edition campaign.  Think of it as a more refined and freer version, where thousands of people helped to make the system better.

* [System Reference Document](http://www.opengamingfoundation.org/srd.html) - The "open" content of D&D.  Basically, the player's guide, DM's guide, etc.

* [Hypertext D20 System Reference Document](http://d20srd.org) - A version of the SRD designed for the web.  Spells are cross-linked, and tables are added whenever they are used.  All of the open and free content in a nice, web-friendly version.

* [Pathfinder D20 System Reference Document](http://d20pfsrd.com) - Like the one above, but includes all of the Pathfinder rules and has tons of additional content.

* [Open Gaming Foundation](http://www.opengamingfoundation.org/) - Lots of new d20 books are now able to work interchangeably.  This foundation is spearheading the movement, and is also backed/created by Wizards of the Coast.

* [Wu Jen](http://www.geocities.com/winspir/) - Wonderful Excel spreadsheets covering items, spells, characters, and a very large one that will help generate random monster encounters.

* [The Alignment System](http://easydamus.com/alignment.html) - Thorough site explaining the various aspects of each of the alignments. Includes an alignment test to help you pick the alignment that represents your beliefs.


Software
--------

* [D&D Helper](../../software/dnd-helper/) - Similar to D&D Tools (also on this page), but it does a few more things.  Experience calculator, movement, turning undead, die roller, reference tables.  All for your Palm.

* [Class Construction Kit](classes/classconstruction.pdf) - Make sure new classes and prestige classes seem somewhat balanced.  This is version 1.1a.

* D&D Tools - Freeware Palm OS program to assist the DM.  Experience calculator, time/distance, and turning tables made easy.  I have a local copy of [version 1.00](dndtools100.zip) and also here's a sneak preview of [version 1.02](dungeonhelper.prc) that doesn't require a separate database.

* [AutoREALM](http://autorealm.sourceforge.net/) - Open-source fantasy role-playing mapper software.

* [PCGen](http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/) - Endorsed somewhat by WotC, this also helps you create characters.  I have no idea how good this one is.

* [Dungeon Crafter 2](http://www.dungeoncrafter.com/) - Free tile-based mapping software for Windows.


Amusements
----------

* [Rules of Adventuring](rules/) - Follow these rules and you will likely stay alive.

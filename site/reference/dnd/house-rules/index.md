title: Guenever's House Rules
---

These are changes to the Wizards of the Coast 3.0 d20 system.  Modifications are primarily listed according to the chapter in the Player's Guide that was modified.

Specific rulings to special situations are listed near the bottom.

__NOTE:__ These may no longer be used.  We are now using [Pathfinder] rules for our campaign.


Chapter 1 - Abilities
---------------------


### Bonus 0-Level Spells

Character classes that have access to 0-level spells gain bonus 0-level spells equal to their spell bonus ability modifier.  For example, a sorcerer named Vincent can cast 4 additional 0-level spells per day because of his 18 (+4) Charisma.


### Bonus Languages

Characters gain additional languages besides common and their native tongue equal to their Intelligence modifier.  Also, if a character can speak a language, they can read and write it unless the character is a barbarian (barbarians are illiterate).  Guldon, a dwarf, can normally speak and write Common and Dwarven.  Due to his Intelligence of 15 (+2), he can also speak and write Elven and Gnome.


Chapter 3 - Classes
-------------------


### Weapon Proficiencies

If your class enables you to summon forth a weapon for use (not fabricate one) as a special ability, the character is proficient in its use.  The psionicist, Irwin, has taken a prestige class of Pyrokineticist, which lets him summon forth a whip of fire.  Psionicists normally do not have proficiency in exotic weapons, and a whip is an exotic weapon.  Even without a proficiency in whip, Irwin can use his whip of flame as with no penalty.


Chapter 4 - Skills
------------------


### Jumping

You can reach and grab up to a distance equal to your height x 1.5.


### Profession

Profession is not considered a cross-class for Fighters and Barbarians.


### Speak Language

As a general rule, if you can speak the language, you can read/write the language.


### Wilderness Lore

If you choose a specific climate and terrain for wilderness lore, such as temperate forest, tropical mountains, etc., you gain twice the number of ranks than skill points you allocate.  For example, if this is a class skill and you dump 4 points in, you get a total of 8 ranks.  If this is a cross-class skill, you get 1 rank per point instead of spending 2 points to get 1 rank.


Chapter 5 - Feats
-----------------

Please see the extracted [feats listing](feats/).


Chapter 6 - Description
-----------------------


### Character Background

Characters may gain free skills or languages based on background.  For example, a character who grew up in the mountains might get a bonus to fortitude saves versus cold and cold based spells.  Players are encouraged to write their own elaborate background to increase the chance and numbers of these bonus skills and to create new skills to help customize their characters.

Players are also encouraged to create variants of existing character classes.  For example, elementalist spellcasters are spellcasters with access to elemental schools of magic or domains (see 2<sup>nd</sup> edition Tome of Magic), or shamans who appeal to spirits and entice, convince, or force them to do favors.


Chapter 11 - Spells (Changed Spells)
------------------------------------


### Wish

Wish can be used to change the spells known for a Sorcerer or Wizard.  The newly accessible spell must replace a spell of the same level, so you could wish to be able to use Magic Missile instead of Burning Hands.  The new spell must also be a sorcerer/wizard spell, and not one that is from a prohibited school.


Chapter 11 - Spells (Additional Spells)
---------------------------------------


### Call Familiar

Transmutation [Teleportation]

_Level:_  Sor/Wiz 3

_Range:_  1 mile

_Components:_  V, S

_Duration:_  Instantaneous

_Casting Time:_  1 action

_Target:_  Caster's familiar

_Saving Throw:_  None

_Spell Resistance:_  Yes (harmless)

This spell summons your familiar into your presence from up to 1 mile away (within the range of your empathic link).  The familiar appears immediately, anywhere within arm's reach of you.


### Familiar's Form

Necromancy

_Level:_  Sor/Wiz 3

_Range:_  Medium (100 ft + 10 ft/level)

_Components:_  V, S

_Duration:_  Until the caster returns to his body

_Casting Time:_  1 action

_Target:_  Caster's familiar

_Saving Throw:_  None

_Spell Resistance:_  No

With a round of concentration, you can transfer your mind and spirit into your familiar's body as if you were using a _magic jar_ spell.  Your familiar's spirit is harmlessly suppressed while you inhabit its body and your body falls into a death-like trance.  You can use your familiar's body as if it were your own.  If your familiar is normally capable of speech, you can cast spells with verbal components.  If your body is killed while you are in your familiar's form, you become trapped there.  When your familiar dies while you are possessing it, you are automatically returned to your own body and suffer the normal effects of your familiar's demise.  You cannot return to your own body unless your familiar is within range of the spell.  You cannot use this spell if your familiar is a construct -- instead, they have a special ability called 'vessel'.


### Familiar's Sense

Divination

_Level:_  Sor/Wiz 2

_Range:_  See text

_Components:_  V, S

_Duration:_  1 minute/level

_Casting Time:_  1 action

_Target:_  Caster's familiar

_Saving Throw:_  None

_Spell Resistance:_  Yes (harmless)

Familiar's Sense allows you to perceive some of what your familiar does, regardless of the distance between you.  As a partial action each round for the duration of the spell, you can replace one of your senses with one of your familiar's senses.  For example, the round the spell is cast, you can choose sight and see only through your familiar's eyes.  The following round, you can choose to hear and hear only what your familiar hears, but regain your own sight.  The familiar doesn't lose any of its senses when you borrow them.

This spell does not grant you the ability to communicate with your familiar if it is outside the range of the empathic link.  You use your normal Listen and Spot skills to notice things, modified by the familiar's Alertness feat.  Lead or magical protections block the spell.


### Familiar's Touch

Conjuration

_Level:_  Sor/Wiz 2

_Range:_  Medium (100 ft + 10 ft/level)

_Components:_  V, S

_Duration:_  1 minute/level

_Casting Time:_  1 action

_Target:_  Caster's familiar

_Saving Throw:_  None

_Spell Resistance:_  No

After casting this spell, you can cast any spells with a range of Touch through your familiar (your familiar touches the intended target to deliver the spell's effect).  Unlike the normal familiar touch ability, you and your familiar do not need to be in physical contact when the spell is cast.  The familiar must still make a touch attack against the target to deliver the spell.


### Share Life

Necromancy

_Level:_  Sor/Wiz 2

_Range:_  Touch

_Components:_  V, S

_Duration:_  1 full round

_Casting Time:_  1 action

_Target:_  Caster's familiar

_Saving Throw:_  None

_Spell Resistance:_  No

Share life allows you to transfer some of your life force to your familiar.  You can transfer a number of hit points equal to your level to your familiar by touch, healing any damage it has suffered by taking the damage onto yourself.  You cannot increase your familiar's hit points beyond its normal level; you can only heal damage it has suffered.  This does not work with construct nor undead familiars.


Chapter 12 - Prestige Classes
-----------------------------


Below are changes to the way that prestige classes work, and then specific prestige classes are listed.


### Psionic Prestige Classes

The character's prestige class level stacks with her Psychic Warrior or Psion level for the purposes of determining manifester level (unless otherwise specified).  Irwin Salamander, a 3rd level Psion also has 1 level in Pyrokineticist, his manifester level will be treated as 4 unless stated otherwise.  However, if there is a character that is multiclassed as a Psion and a Psychic Warrior, and that character puts their next level into a psionic prestige class, the prestige class's level only benefits either the Psion manifester level or the Psychic Warrior manifester level.  This must be chosen when the prestige class level is gained.  This is similar to the effect of "+1 level of existing class" for Wizard and Cleric prestige classes.


### Pyrokineticist (Psionics Handbook)

_Fire Mastery:_  At 2nd level, the Pyrokineticist gains the Fire Mastery feat.  This allows the pyrokineticist does more damage with his innate fire attacks as he gains levels.  The damage done with the Touch Aflame, Fire Lash, Hand Afire, and Weapon Afire abilities is increased by 1 point/2 class levels.  So, a 5th level Pyrokineticist would have an additional +2 points, and a 6th level Pyrokineticist would have +3.

Bolt of Fire:  Up to 1 power point per class level can be spent with each use of this ability.  The damage done is 1d6 per power point spent.


### Slayer (Psionics Handbook)

The book lists Slayers as "proficient with all weapons and armor." Slayers have been modified to be proficient with all armor, all shields, and all simple and martial weapons.


Chapter 13 - Psionics
---------------------

Psionics use the "psionics are different" rules variant.

New psionic powers:


### Heal Other

Psychokinesis (Con)

_Level:_  Psion 3 / Psychic Warrior 3

_Display:_  Au, Ma

_Manifestation Time:_  1 full round

_Range:_  Touch

_Target:_  1 person

_Power Points:_  Maximum of 4 (for healing) + 1 (activation)

You may heal others by resting your hands on them.  One power point is used for activating this power.  Each power point spent beyond the activation cost, up to four beyond the activation cost, is used to restore 1d8 hit points to the target.


Chapter 14 - Familiars
----------------------


### New Familiar Types

_Bird_ - Owl, hawk, falcon, eagle, gulls, pelicans, crow, parrot.  Owls have superb night vision but tend to be inactive during the day.  Crows and parrots can speak one language (usually common) in a croaking voice.  Predatory birds can hunt or be fed fresh meat.  Crows will also eat carrion.  Other birds generally eat seeds, nuts, and berries.

_Dog_ - Dogs can use their superb senses of smell and hearing to see past simple deceptions.  Dog familiars grant their owners a +2 bonus to Sense Motive checks.

_Fox_ - Good hunters and even better at evading predators.  Fox are carnivorous and grant their spell casters a +2 bonus to Reflex saves.

_Hare_ - Larger cousin of the rabbit, they tend to be skittish, although hare familiars are much braver than others of their kind.  Keen senses of smell and hearing, swift runners, good jumpers.  Hare familiars grant +2 bonus to Listen checks and eat all sorts of vegetables.

_Lizard_ - Geckos, iguanas, chameleons, etc.  Found in warm (often tropical) forested areas.  Good climbers, eat insects and small animals, prefer live food (some eat fresh meat or sometimes food).  Lizards grant +2 bonus to Climb checks.

_Mouse_ - Very good at hiding, and grant a +2 bonus to Hide checks.  Cannot do any damage in combat.  Primarily eat vegetables and grains.

_Otter_ - Clever amphibious animals.  Good swimmers and divers.  Otters grant a +2 bonus to Swim checks to the owner.

_Raccoon_ - Grant a +2 bonus to Pick Pockets checks for their masters.

_Skunk_ - When threatened, can spray a foul-smelling musk 10 feet, and hits with a successful ranged touch attack.  If the attack hits, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds.  A skunk familiar's master is immune to the musk attacks of all skunks.  Only one target can be affected by the musk, and only once per day.  Skunks are omnivorous and particularly enjoy eating insects.

_Squirrel_ - Excellent climbers and jumpers.  Can gnaw through soft wood, leather, rope.  Can pick up small objects (but not carry, since they run on all fours).  They eat fruit, nuts, grains.  Squirrels grant a +2 bonus to Reflex saves.

_Other Animals_ - Other small, plain animals can be used as familiars.  More exotic or dangerous animals might be familiars if you get the Improved Familiar (Tome and Blood) feat.


Special Rulings
---------------

These rulings helped to handle odd situations whenever they arose.  These rules are superseded by [Pathfinder] in our next campaign if Pathfinder conflicts with these rulings.


### Soul Swapping

If your mind is placed into another person's body, the following rules will determine the skills available to you:

* Physical attributes (Str, Dex, Con, gender, size, age, etc.) go with the body.
* Mental attributes (Int, Wis, alignment, level, etc.) go with the mind.
* Charisma is averaged out (round down).
* Any racial bonuses for the ability points go with the body.
* Hit Points and Initiative, functions of Constitution and Dexterity, go with the body, unless a modifier fits under another rule, such as Improved Initiative.
* Fortitude and Reflex saves stay with the body.  Will saves travel with the mind.
* Base attack, a function of your level, travels with the mind.
* Skills, feats, spells, psionic powers, and languages travel with the mind, but if the new body doesn't have the prerequisites to use the ability, then the ability is unusable.  Feats require prerequisite abilities, languages require a way to speak, etc.


### Spells

Casting *fly* on a creature that already had *fly* cast upon it will act like the two fly spells are overlapping and the time will be extended.  For example, if *fly* lasts for 10 minutes and you get it cast upon yourself twice at the same time, then you get to fly for 10 minutes.  If you get *fly* cast upon you 5 minutes into the spell's duration, then you are allowed to fly for a total of 15 minutes.  By casting this at the end of the spell, you could fly for an indefinite period.

This also applies to other spells, like *shrink item*.  Essentially, the spells "stack", and as long as one is active, the spell effect is active.

Using any variant of *teleport* that lets you teleport yourself and optionally your equipment, you decide what goes with you.  If you choose for another person to go with you, that other person decides what objects go with him/her.  For instance, you are in a classroom with your pal and 10 kids, all of which are touching you.  You decide to teleport your pal and yourself out.  All of your clothing and items go with you, and your pal would probably decide to teleport with all of his possessions.

If you are bound, you can teleport to escape the binding.  Same goes for people that teleport with you.  However, since each person decides what goes with them, it is an individual choice.  If you and your pal are tied up with the same rope and you decide to teleport yourself out, you would likely choose to not take the rope with you.  If you teleport out with your pal, and he (for some dumb reason) decided to teleport with the rope, you both would remain tied up but in a new location.

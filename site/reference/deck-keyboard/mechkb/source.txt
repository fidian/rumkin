/u/fly-hard has generously given us permission to host his LED scripts for the Deck Hassium Pro / Francium Pro. You can find some gifs here.
Owners of the Deck Hassium or Francium Pro can download these LED scripts here.
Also wanted to quickly plug that we will now be using Fedex for express shipments into the US. We have had very good experiences with Fedex in the past for commercial shipments, they are also a bit cheaper than Australia Post for shipments over 1.5/2kgs. You can find out more information about this as well as our new arrivals here.
Happy clickin' clackin' everyone!

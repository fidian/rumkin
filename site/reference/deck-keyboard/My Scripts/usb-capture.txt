Lots of bluetooth mouse events between things.  Sorry.  Device is 27, IIRC

Send blank script to slot 0
Send sample 1 (Francium version) to slot 1
Fetch keymap from keyboard (prompted for name, typed in "asdf" before transfer)
Store same keymap to keyboard

0x04 = A when coming from keyboard, as in "save file as asdf"

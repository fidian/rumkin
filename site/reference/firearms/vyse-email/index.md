title: Vyse Email
---

The below is an email I received from Vyse.  It seems more like a scare tactic that implies I would be legal trouble.  Needless to say, my response was civil but I didn't change from mentioning Knox.

I've been told by visitors to the site that the Vyse company are effectively bullies and deliver a sub-par product.  Also I have been informed that their claim to the generic "ballistics gel" term is completely fictional.  This email has been displayed on my site for over 10 years and I have received no legal action from this company.

    You should add Vyse gelatin to you list of suppliers of gelatin
    They can buy the REAL thing from us. We hold the trade mark on “BALLISTIC GELATIN”
    We can ship it to the customers door at a cost that is lower than any place.

    It is the same product that the military, FBI, and most ammo manufacturers are using.

    I’m not sure off hand but, you could be in legal jeopardy by use our trade mark without permission.
    It is possible that if you replace the Knox name with Vyse, the matter would be dismissed.

    President

The below is an email I received from Vyse.  It seems more like a scare tactic that implies I would be legal trouble.  Needless to say, my response was civil but I didn't change from mentioning Knox.

I've been told by visitors to the site that the Vyse company are effectively bullies and deliver a sub-par product.  Also I have been informed that their claim to the generic "ballistics gel" term is completely fictional.  I suspect it was some sort of scare tactic.  This email has been displayed on my site for over 10 years and I have received no legal action from this company.

You should add Vyse gelatin to you list of suppliers of gelatin<br />
They can buy the REAL thing from us. We hold the trade mark on &#8220;BALLISTIC GELATIN&#8221;<br />
We can ship it to the customers door at a cost that is lower than any place. <br />
<br />
It is the same product that the military, FBI, and most ammo &nbsp;manufacturers are using.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m not sure off hand but, &nbsp;you could be in legal jeopardy by use our trade mark without permission. &nbsp;<br />
It is possible that if you replace the Knox name with Vyse, the matter would be dismissed.<br />

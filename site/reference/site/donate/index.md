I am really glad that you found something on my web site worthy enough for you to donate some of your funds my way!  I have set up a PayPal account so you can use a credit card to send me whatever amount you'd like.  Just press the button below to get started.

The money that is donated to me does go back into the site.  I pay for my hosting and hardware upgrades primarily out of my own pocket, so the money I get in from this site helps to just offset those costs.  When people send me even a dollar, I really appreciate it.

I would greatly prefer amounts over 2 dollars or maybe just 0.99 because of how PayPal's fees work.  Under a dollar is free.  There's about a 33% fee for $1 and it drops down to an 18% fee at $2.  However, I leave the amount up to you.

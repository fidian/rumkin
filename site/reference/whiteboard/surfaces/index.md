I have tried numerous types of surfaces in order to find one that is cheap and easy for people to use.  My findings may help you decide what you'd like to try.  This is a section of my [whiteboards](../) reference.  You can also find interesting ways to [clean your whiteboard](../cleaners/) to a bright and beautiful blank slate.

With each surface comes advantages and disadvantages.  Some methods are broken down by use; you have different needs if you want one large whiteboard instead of twenty small whiteboards.  I've attempted to rate how well the surfaces perform and how expensive they are.

I rated the surfaces on their ability to be erased with whiteboard markers only.  Ghosting, residue, and difficulty wiping away the marks all lead to a worse score.  I also try to use new surfaces because the wear on a whiteboard can cause it to become a worse surface.  I had a commercial whiteboard that has seen its share of use and it was worse than using a shower board!

The price factor reflects the approximate cost to cover a wall in the material, or essentially the cost for the surface area.  Most commercial whiteboards would get a very poor price rating even though they operate very well.

Try to keep in mind that the quality of the marker and how it works with the surface is also a key factor in judging a surface.  If it doesn't work for you, but I say it works well, try a different brand of marker and hope for the best.

If your company manufactures a whiteboard surface, you can send me a test sample for me to try.  I'll put your product up here and I'll give you a review.  However, you are not guaranteed to have a positive review if it just doesn't work.  My reviews are honest and I don't withhold negative comments.

This is a table with a quick comparison of surfaces.  The higher the score, the better it works with whiteboard markers.  The lower the price, the more economical it is (ie. it saves more money as the score goes up).  A "?" means I did not test this product yet.

packcramfs -c|--create [-i|--images n] [-b|--blocksize blocksize]
                       [-l|--loop n] (blocckdevice|file) blocks
           create new multi cramfs partition with n partitions (default 16),
           and the given number of blocks of the given size (default block
           size is 1024). The loopoffset defines the first loopdevice that
           is used to mount images
packcramfs -p|--print [-a|--all] [-t|--terse] (blockdevice|file)
           print information about the active images or all images [-a]
packcramfs -D|--deactivate (blockdevice|file) n
           Deactivate image n (it is not deleted). It will also unmount all
           partitions before deactivating the partition.
packcramfs -D|--deactivate (blockdevice|file) mountpoint
           Deactivate image using the given mountpoint. It will also unmount
           all partitions before deactive the partition.
packcramfs -s|--store [-f|--force] [--append] (blockdevice|file)
                                        mountpoint file [mountpoint file ...]
           store new cramfs file image without disturbing the others unless
           -f is given. -f will also unmount all partitions. --append will
           append the partitions to the end of the file/device.
packcramfs -x|--extract (blockdevice|file) (mountpoint|imagenumber) [filename]
           Extract a given mountpoint (if there is more than one the active
           one is used, if none is active the first one) to the fil or stdout.
packcramfs -A|--activate (blockdevice|file) mountpoint [mountpoint ...]
           activate mountpoints after unmounting all partitions.
packcramfs -r|--restore (blockdevice|file)
           restore a partition by reactivating all deactivated images which
           where either deleted with -d or replaced with -s. Only one or more
           -d or one -s can be restored and it -r cannot be used if --force
           was used. It will unmount all partitions before restoring.
packcramfs -m|--mount (blockdevice|file) root
           Mount all images starting with /
packcramfs -u|--umount (blockdevice|file)
           unmount everything
packcramfs -C|--check [-a|--all] [-w|--write] [--resize] [-I|--image] [--fast]
                                                           (blockdevice|file)
           Check active (or all) partitions for CRC errors. Works even if the
           partitions are mounted. In the case of an error one should
           unmount everything and use -w|--write to fix the error or restore
           the previous version using --restore. If --resize is used with a
           block device the size of the filesystem will be changed to use the
           complete device, if it is used with a file it will truncate the file
           to make it as small as possible (without moving partitions). Using 
           -I means that a single cramfs image instead of a complete packed 
           partitions must be checked. --fast does not check the images but
           only the partition table
packcramfs -z|--compress (blockdevice|file)
           compress the archive, remove all non active partitions. Will first
           unmount all partitions.

OPTIONS:   -q|--quiet         print less information
           -a|--all           print all partitions/images
           -f|--force         force changes
           -P|--progress-bar  print progress bar

EXIT CODES:  0 on success
             errors below 128 are non fatal error messages, above 128 are fatal

             1 if one superblock is corrupt and should be fixed. However, the
               program could still finish successfully.

           129 if the option --force should be used
           130 if there are not enough partitions left
           131 if the cramfs files passed as argument are corrupt
           132 if the superblock is corrupt
           133 if there was a write error
           134 if there is not enough space on the device
           135 if the arguments are wrong
           136 if there was a problem mounting/unmounting due to a busy file
               or device
           137 if check removed some partitions (or recommends to remove them)
               because of errors
           138 if there was an internal error (out of memory, ...)

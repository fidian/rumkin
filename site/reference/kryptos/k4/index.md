On Kryptos, the last 97 characters look like this.

Sanborn has mentioned that the length is indeed 97 characters in [an interview](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/30/801323608/a-new-and-final-clue-to-kryptos-a-long-standing-puzzle). He's also given [several clues](https://elonka.com/kryptos/) and confirmed that the letters [directly map](http://numberworld.blogspot.com/2018/07/kryptos-cipher-part-3.html) from the cipher text to the plain text. From this, we know the following letters are correct in the message. Perhaps this is to cut down on the number of people mailing him thousands of incorrect solutions.

It is possible that the first `EAST` in the plain text isn't correct. Sanborn did confirm it, but it's possible that it was confirmed out of hand as opposed to being intentional. He previously leaked `NORTHEAST` and a member of the Kryptos group asked him about `EASTNORTHEAST` being in a specific location and Sandborn confirmed it.

<div class="Bdw(1px) Bgc(#ddd) P(0.5em) Whs(pl) My(0.5em)"><tt>
                           ....<br />
.................EASTNORTHEAST.<br />
............................BER<br />
LINCLOCK.......................
</tt></div>

If we trust Sanborn, then we can assume this is not a transposition cipher, though perhaps that's [not right](https://kryptools.com/hints.htm).

The cipher method probably doesn't involve math. Sanborn admitted he's bad at math during [an interview](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/30/801323608/a-new-and-final-clue-to-kryptos-a-long-standing-puzzle), and had this to say at a different interview.

`EASTNORTHEAST` is the same direction as the compass etched into a stone located in the same area as the bent metal shape that most consider to be Kryptos. Sanborn considers the whole installment to be Kryptos.

The clock in Berlin is a special clock that inspired Sanborn. It shows the time using lights in base-5. When asked about this clock, Sanborn said, "There are several really interesting clocks in Berlin." He added, "You’d better delve into that particular clock."

Elonka Dunin received an anonymous clue as an instant message:

There's also a [lot of information](http://numberworld.blogspot.com/2018/07/kryptos-cipher-part-3.html) over at Number World. Kryptools tracks [more hints from interviews](https://kryptools.com/hints.htm).

## Open Questions

* Do the misspelled words in [K1](../k1/) and [K2](../k2/) figure into this cipher, or are they for [K5](../k5/)?

* The Vigenère tableau on the other side of the Kryptos sculpture has an extra letter `L` at the end of one of the lines. If you read down the last column, you can see the word `HILL`. Is that a hint towards a Hill Cipher?

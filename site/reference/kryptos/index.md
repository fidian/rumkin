title: Kryptos Tools and Notes
summary: A tool I wrote for Elonka.

## Tools

* [Online Cipher Tools](../../tools/cipher/) - A collection of cipher tools that work in your browser. Nothing is sent to my server.
* [Elonka's VigenÃ¨re Cipher](elonka.html) - A self-contained VigenÃ¨re tool I created. You can save it locally and work offline on parts of Kryptos.

## The Cipher

I love that Jim Sanborn created an encoded cipher and he has given out clues to help get it solved, even going so far as to give out his [encryption sheets](https://kryptools.com/Sheets/sheets.htm).

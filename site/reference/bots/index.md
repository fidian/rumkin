title: Programming Bots
---

I'm a self-proclaimed computer geek.  As such, I like to have games where you make a strategy, program a robot to follow the strategy, and kill everyone else on the playing field.


[GarBots]
---------

Back when I wrote this page, I found that having a few minutes here and there really was spent well by playing Garbots on my Palm.  There's a lot more information at my [GarBots] page.


WarBots
-------

This was my first bot programming game that I ever played.  Since it is so hard to find, I have a [local copy](warbots.zip) lying around.  Warbots was programmed by Chris Busch in Turbo Pascal.  The program runs in DOS and requires an EGA/VGA screen (everyone has these now, right?).

I wrote a bot that drove around backwards.  If it found another robot, it would cream the area, move forward, turn around, and shoot four or five times in a row.  Worked quite well.

I also wrote a crack some time back and I can't find it anymore.  It would decrypt the `.war` files that were password encrypted.  The encryption method used is just a simple XOR stream cipher.

Ever have a weird problem that you couldn't figure out how to get rid of it?  I have.  Sometimes the information isn't even on the web when I search for the answer, or else the answer is split up and scattered across numerous web pages.  Because of that, I have collected my goofy problems here on this page in the hopes that it will save another person some time.

Yes, that is a short list.  I don't believe in making a page to cover a problem whose answer is easily found with a search engine.

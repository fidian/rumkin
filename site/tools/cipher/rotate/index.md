### Temporarily Broken

> **September 2022:** I'm busy and haven't gotten to this one yet. I will. In
> the last month, I've added many ciphers: rail fence, Übchi, Vigenère
> (including keyed and autokey Vigenère), ROT13. I've also added a text
> analyzer, cryptogram solver, examples to all of the ciphers, visible
> tableaus, and extra actions for the text input. Please feel free to email me
> about changes you want to see.
>
> **August 2022:** I have to switch web hosting providers. This page will be
> rewritten in the upcoming weeks, but is not yet ready. Sorry, I don't have
> lots of free time to make this change happen faster.

The Lego Bionicle universe has a few written languages and they are simply a substitution cipher that replaces letters with symbols. The Matoran language can be written using circles or hexagons, depending on where they are used.

<div class="D(f) Ai(c) Fxd(c)">

There's also the Okotan symbols used on Okoto.

During World War I, the Germans used a double columnar transposition cipher called Übchi ("ubchi" with umlauts).  For a bit more information about columnar transposition ciphers, see [that cipher's page](../columnar-transposition/). This method is surprisingly similar to the U.S. Army's [double columnar transposition](../double-columnar-transposition/), also used during World War I.

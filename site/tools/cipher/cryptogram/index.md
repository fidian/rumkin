This tool helps you decode ciphers. It's extremely flexible, allowing multiple cipher text symbols to map to a single plain text letter, symbol, or even emoji. To use this, you enter the cryptoquip or cryptogram to be translated and a table of replacement letters will be shown. From here, you can manipulate the letter mapping and attempt to find a solution.

The figures presented here are based on information from the [United Nations](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/ASCII/). These are estimates. While this is fun to watch and is roughly accurate, the numbers do not reflect the real population. This performs a straight-line estimate for populations, assuming the rates do not change.

Numbers and notes will automatically update with new information whenever a new simulated birth, death or migration happens. The information about the person's age is randomly generated based on percentages of actual deaths in the country, but certainly does not represent a real person.

Estimates use your computer's time, so use the right time or you'll have very inaccurate results.

This degree converter will let you change your latitude and longitude values between degrees (D); degrees and minutes (DM); and degrees, minutes, seconds (DMS). They are used for various different software packages and with a GPS.

The calculations are very simple and already exist on other web sites, but I decided to make my own so I could have it be small, fast, and feature-packed. Well, maybe not really feature-packed, but it does work surprisingly well.

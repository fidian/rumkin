I'm sorry to say this, but it is time for this project to come to an end.  I've decided it was time because the project did not receive any donations in the past year.  During the year it received and handled 35,479 uploads.

To be fair, I had the uploader running for well over 10 years.  In that time, 29 wonderful people donated a total of $124.17 (after PayPal's meager fees), with an average donation of about $4.28.  In the end, getting less than $0.40 per *year* for this service wasn't enough to compensate for the headaches.  I wasn't in this for the money.  I only asked for enough to cover the hosting fees, but that never really happened.

My website was also completely free of advertising, except for this one section.  The total revenue drawn over those years is double what I received from PayPal.  Again, not really worth the time it took to put the ads on my site and I never really liked having any advertising on this domain.

I did spend hours upgrading this with each time the code needed to run on a new server or to remove performance bottlenecks.  Dealing with the reports of it not working, problems with people's phones, and the issues revolving around child porn all contributed to the problems hosting it.

Do you want to host this uploader yourself?  That's great!  I'm releasing the source code and you're welcome to get it running.

* [2015-07-10](20150710.zip) - Snapshot of the files right before I took the site down.  The database was removed and now the filesystem is used again, but in a much better way.
* [2005-10-19](20051019.zip) - Earlier snapshot.  Refined the database and the code.
* [2004-02-03](20040203.zip) - Even earlier.  Added a database.
* [Super Old](older.zip) - This one is so old that it didn't even use a database to store the files.

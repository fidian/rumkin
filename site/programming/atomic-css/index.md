title: Atomic CSS
summary: A CSS technique to make modular CSS.  Blends together many other ideas in a controversial way to put simplicity and maintainability as its primary goals.  Works on a wide variety of site sizes from a landing page to an enterprise's online shopping site, from a single page application to static pages.
---

Every web developer's dream is to have CSS that is all of the following.

* __Maintainable__ - I should be able to change colors and padding easily
* __Readable__ - Simpler classes, uncomplicated rules
* __Immediately understandable__ - Easy concepts to understand and learning curves cause problems
* __Consistent across browsers__ - Including different versions of the same browsers
* __Responsive__ - Changing to screen size, media, and more
* __Able to be themed__ - Especially when the design team says to change all disclaimer text
* __Sturdy__ - Do not couple to the HTML structure to avoid brittleness
* __Reusable__ - When is the last time you reused any CSS?

It might surprise you, but ...


You Can Achieve This!
---------------------

It sounds too good to be true, right?

By combining a set of techniques for managing CSS, you can completely transform how you approach this problem of styling web pages.  Instead of wanting to run away you will think that keeping this site up to date is easy.

You can also incrementally add this to your existing site.

You also are __not__ required to use a preprocessor such as [Sass] and [Less].  They are fantastic and I encourage their use, but no tools are not necessary to use this technique.


It's Different
--------------

Be forewarned - this approach is controversial.  A good deal of it was introduced in a Smashing Magazine article about [Challenging CSS Best Practices] where Thierry discussed an atomic approach to CSS.  Initially you may shun this idea as well, but please continue to read through the examples, arguments, and ideas for improvement that are detailed here.

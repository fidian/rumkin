<p>I&#39;m a self-proclaimed computer geek. As such, I like to have games where you make a strategy, program a robot to follow the strategy, and kill everyone else on the playing field.</p><h2 id=garbots><a href=garbots/ >GarBots</a></h2><p>Back when I wrote this page, I found that having a few minutes here and there really was spent well by playing Garbots on my Palm. There&#39;s a lot more information at my <a href=garbots/ >GarBots</a> page.</p><h2 id=warbots>WarBots</h2><p>This was my first bot programming game that I ever played. Since it is so hard to find, I have a <a href=warbots.zip>local copy</a> lying around. Warbots was programmed by Chris Busch in Turbo Pascal. The program runs in DOS and requires an EGA/VGA screen (everyone has these now, right?).</p><p>I wrote a bot that drove around backwards. If it found another robot, it would cream the area, move forward, turn around, and shoot four or five times in a row. Worked quite well.</p><p>I also wrote a crack some time back and I can&#39;t find it anymore. It would decrypt the <code>.war</code> files that were password encrypted. The encryption method used is just a simple XOR stream cipher.</p><h2 id=links>Links</h2><ul><li><a href=http://tpga.virtualave.net/game-links.htm>AIForge</a> (<a href=http://www.gammax.net/aiforge/game-links.htm>alternate</a>) - Listing of different programming games.</li><li><a href=http://www.gamerz.net/c++robots/ >C++Robots</a> - Write your bot in C++, play by email, king of the hill competitions.</li><li><a href=http://directory.google.com/Top/Games/Video_Games/Genres/Simulation/Programming_Games/ >Google&#39;s List</a> - Lots and lots of programming games.</li><li><a href=http://www.iit.edu/~wardjon/robots.html>Evolving Virtual Robots</a> - How one person started to evolve robots.</li><li><a href=http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/ >RealTimeBattle</a> - Program your robot in whatever language you wish.</li><li><a href=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~stever/games/ >Programming Games</a> - A list of different programming games with descriptions.</li></ul>

This is a great little game for teaching the fundamentals of programming. Make sure you visit the <a href=http://www.hares.net/bot.htm>Official Site</a> to download the program and so you can contact Scott and tell him what a good program this is.</p><h2 id=notes-on-protection>Notes on Protection</h2><p>I don&#39;t get a link off the <a href=http://www.hares.net/bot.htm>Official Site</a>, and it is probably because I have released the following information. You can unprotect bot <code>.pdb</code> files by opening it up in a hex editor and changing just a byte. If the first byte of a record has the bit flag 0x02 turned on, just flip that one bit to unprotect the record.</p><h2 id=bots-i-wrote>Bots I Wrote</h2><p>I left all of these unprotected as there&#39;s no point in trying to hide the code.</p><ul><li><a href=wal-mart.pdb>Wal-Mart</a> - Just shoots the walls. When I first started playing GarBots, too many bots hung out around the walls.</li><li><a href=maz.pdb>Maz</a> - Drives around and shoots randomly around the arena. Also, tends to pick on things hanging out near walls.</li><li><a href=path.pdb>Path</a> A pool vacuum gave me the idea to create a robot that just drove in straight lines, killing things in front of it. It turns when it hits a wall. Sometimes it gets hung up near corners, but it usually gets out before dying.</li></ul><h2 id=testing-robots>Testing Robots</h2><p>These are just simple robots that you can use to spruce things up or to help you out with finding information.</p><ul><li><a href=bugbot.pdb>Bugbot</a> - Illustrates the <code>FIRE</code> bug. It just shoots off the screen and everyone dies.</li><li><a href=count.pdb>Count</a> and <a href=count2.pdb>Count2</a> - These work in conjunction to provide timing information. Replace the comment in Count with the code you want to test, then run Count and Count2 in a battle with the Battle Speed at 1. The last line you see is the amount of time the command took.</li><li><a href=minimum-radius.pdb>Minimum Radius</a> - Checks to see what radius truly can kill you. <code>DAMAGERAD</code> is just a bit too small when dealing with integer math. See the Code Snippets for my calculation.</li><li><a href=moving-drone.pdb>Moving Drone</a> - Hmmm. A moving drone. Target practice.</li></ul><h2 id=other-open-bots>Other &quot;Open&quot; Bots</h2><p>The word &quot;open&quot; is in quotes because there&#39;s really no protection for any bot, but these authors have intentionally published their bots&#39; source code for others to peruse.</p><ul><li><a href=k-drone.pdb>K-Drone</a> - Emailed to the GarBots mailing list by cozmikforz. Provided here as a file so that nobody needs to actually type in the code by hand. Drives around and shoots. Very similar to Fleeter by Rudi.</li></ul><h2 id=modified-bots>Modified Bots</h2><p>These are bots that I modified to run faster and be more aggressive. Some I also fixed a bit. Code is protected (as they were originally).</p><ul><li><a href=cruiser2.pdb>Cruiser2</a> - Originally from Rudi&#39;s Site. I combined multiple assignments and moved some math into the scan line.</li><li><a href=death-tank-4.pdb>Death Tank 4</a> - Originally from the <a href=http://www.hares.net/bot.htm>Official Site</a>. I removed <code>GOSUB</code> functions, and made the scan randomly pick the direction to get some robots that would have been missed.</li><li><a href=fleeter-2.pdb>Fleeter 2</a> - Originally from Rudi&#39;s Site. Very hard to improve on this little guy. I made it so that it couldn&#39;t hurt itself, and I made the first shot come off a little faster.</li><li><a href=lord-of-the-rings-2.pdb>Lord of the Rings 2</a> - Originally from Rudi&#39;s Site. A very nice robot. I made it avoid damaging itself, removed <code>GOSUB</code> functions, had it initially driven to its starting spot without starting in the center, and sped it up a bit. Excellent concept!</li><li><a href=smack-down-2.pdb>Smack Down 2</a> - Originally from the <a href=http://www.hares.net/bot.htm>Official Site</a>. I removed the <code>GOSUB</code> functions, unnecessary assignments, and made the first shot fire faster.</li><li><a href=sniper-2.pdb>Sniper 2</a> - Originally from Rudi&#39;s Site. I made it pick a random direction, removed the <code>WHILE</code> loop around the program, combined assignments, removed <code>GOTO</code>s (which were used like <code>GOSUB</code>s), and corrected the program to think that the target is on the other side if a sub-scan missed its mark. Works great against non-moving drones.</li></ul><h2 id=even-more-links>Even More Links</h2><ul><li><a href=http://www.hares.net/bot.htm>Official Site</a> - You have to go here.</li><li>[Yahoo GarBots Group] - Some messages, some files, some links. Nothing too fancy, but you have to be a member before you can even see the message archive.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, Rudi&#39;s site was taken offline.</p><h2 id=bugs>Bugs</h2><p>As much as I don&#39;t want there to be any bugs in the program, there are a few. However, Scott told me that several of these will be addressed in the next release and more will be fixed later.</p><h3 id=scanning>Scanning</h3><p>Scan should scan a full radius, not just a triangle. I don&#39;t care if the picture just shows a triangle, I want to actually scan the full distance. I submitted some code to do this, and it should be fixed in the next release.</p><h3 id=shooting>Shooting</h3><p>Shoot off the screen. Everyone dies. See &quot;Bugbot.&quot; Problem is fixed in the next release.</p><h3 id=random-numbers>Random Numbers</h3><p>The <code>RAND</code> function doesn&#39;t work as expected. To counter the problem, I have a snippet of code in my Code Snippets section. This should be fixed in the next release after 1.4.1.</p><h3 id=damage-radius>Damage Radius</h3><p>This works fine when you shoot in a cardinal direction (N/S/E/W). If you do any other angle, you&#39;re going to get hurt. To counter this problem, I have another snippet of code that will work for you. This is due to integer math. This should maybe get fixed in the code, so that bots that are 6.00001 away don&#39;t get hurt. That just relies upon a better distance function, which I submitted.</p><h3 id=logic>Logic</h3><p>It would be nice if <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>!=</code> (or <code>&lt;&gt;</code>) were supported. This should be implemented in the next release after 1.4.1.</p><h3 id=auto-off>Auto Off</h3><p>Not only is there a spelling error next to the &quot;Disable Auto Off&quot; checkbox, but it also doesn&#39;t work. Scott is working on this.</p><h3 id=editor>Editor</h3><p>The scrolling in the editor only scrolls one line at a time. Additionally, the scroll bar is not updated properly after pasting in information, causing a headache when I put in large amounts of code and then I want to go to the end of the program. Scott is working on this. I also suggested an optional smaller font so that I could see more code on the screen.</p><h3 id=math-functions>Math Functions</h3><p><code>SIN</code>, <code>COS</code>, <code>TAN</code>, and <code>ATAN</code> are provided. It would be nice to have the inverse of these functions available as well. That way I could figure out how wide of an area to scan based on DAMAGERAD. <code>a = 2 * (INVSIN (DAMAGERAD / SCANRAD))</code>. This may be implemented in the next release after 1.4.1.</p><h2 id=command-timing-mechanics>Command Timing Mechanics</h2><p>Each robot is processed in the game alphabetically. Therefore, if your robot comes alphabetically before the other robots, you have an advantage. From there, each robot has five ticks, for a lack of a better term. A tick is like a second. It&#39;s the smallest unit of measurable time that I found.</p><table><thead><tr><th>What</th><th align=right>Ticks</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Linefeeds</td><td align=right>1</td><td>Try to avoid blank lines in your code.</td></tr><tr><td>Comments</td><td align=right>0</td><td>Comments on the same line as code is good.

It is better to skip logic entirely when possible.</p></li><li><p>Conversion to/from polar coordinates costs time. Perhaps you can keep everything in one unit instead of doing any conversion. Also, <code>POSX</code> and <code>POSY</code> are a bit expensive, so perhaps keep track of your position. Maybe just move N/S/E/W to make the whole movement thing easier.</p></li><li><p>Determining your damage is not worth your time. By the time you realize that you&#39;re hit and your motor starts moving from the expensive startup cost of <code>DRIVE</code>, you&#39;re likely to be hit again, and therefore dead. Also, since you can&#39;t say <code>if z &lt; DAMAGE()</code> to shorten things up, you&#39;re stuck spending another couple ticks before you can realize that you&#39;re hurting.</p></li><li><p>Driving short distances is extremely spendy. For peak performance, I suggest driving a multiple of drivestep with each <code>DRIVE</code> command.</p></li></ul><p>Each tank gets 5 ticks to do whatever they can, then the other tanks get their turn. If a command goes over your 5 tick boundary, it does get executed, but it will take you a while before you can go again. Let&#39;s say a <code>FIRE</code> command is the first line in your program. When your tank gets control back, you will be able to eventually run 4 <code>PRINT</code> commands or something of equal cost.</p><p>When figuring out the cost for a line, take 1 for the linefeed, plus the cost for whatever else is on that line.</p><p>A list of things that I have learned (via trial and error) is provided here for your amusement.</p><ul><li>Comments and functions are good, but use up time.</li><li>Blank lines are your enemy.</li><li>Good coding techniques are punished. Cut and paste instead of having functions.</li><li>Having a counter to decide which way to scan works well, but it uses up time. You can randomly pick a side to scan faster.</li><li>Using <code>SCAN</code> to cover an area is faster than trying to shoot the entire area.</li><li>X and Y coordinates are great for driving and shooting, but polar don&#39;t need to be converted.</li><li>Damage extends past <code>DAMAGERAD</code> at angles.</li><li>Shoot fast, shoot often.</li><li>Two direct hits at the default settings will wipe out a robot.</li><li>A lingering robot is a dead robot.</li></ul><h2 id=code-snippets>Code Snippets</h2><pre><code>&#39; Code snippets -- Feel free to use.

&#39; Get a random 1 or 0 -- counters the RAND issue mentioned above
r = (rand 100) / 50

&#39; Due to integer math, this is the closest you can fire
&#39; at an arbitrary angle and not get damaged at all.
&#39; I usually add one to this number, just in case.
&#39; See Minimum Radius bot below for proof
d = sqrt (2 * damagerad * damagerad)

&#39; To use it, you can do something like this
s = scan (a - 10) (a + 10)
if s &gt; 0 then
    f = fire a (max s d)
    while f &gt; 0
        f = fire a (max s d)
    next
endif

&#39; How to fire at robots.  A comparison.  The good way is
&#39; just a little faster and a little safer.  Remember to
&#39; remove comments in your program for the sake of speed.
&#39; Bad way                &#39; Good way
a = rand 360             a = rand 360
b = a - 10               s = scan (a - 10) (a + 10)
c = a + 10               if s &gt; 0 then
s = scan b c                 f = fire a (max damagerad s)
if s &gt; 0 then                while f &gt; 0
   f = s                        f = fire a (max damagerad s)
   while f &gt; 0               next
      fire a s           endif
   next                  &#39; You can replace damagerad with d
endif                    &#39; if you use the snippet above

-
    what: Comments

    notes: "`5-7`, `2*areax`, `3` all cost the same."
-
    what: "`WHILE`, `IF`, `FOR`"
    ticks: 1
    notes: "`IF x > 0` and `IF x < 1` cost twice."
-
    what: "`ELSE`, `NEXT`, `ENDIF`"
    ticks: 0
    notes: "`IF x > 0 ... ELSE ...` costs only 1 for the IF."
-
    what: Errors
    ticks: 1
    notes: Test your code thoroughly.
-
    what: "`GOTO`, Labels"
    ticks: 1
    notes: Just having labels costs time.
-
    what: "`GOSUB`, `RETURN`"
    ticks: 1
    notes: Better structured code costs you time.
-
    what: "`RTOP`, `PTOR`"
    ticks: 1
    notes: Conversion to/from polar costs time.

    what: "`DAMAGE()`"
    ticks: 2
    notes: Nearly useless; see below.

<ul>
<li>AU - Auditory: From the manifestr's vicinity or in the vicinity of the
power's subject, a bass-pitched hum issues, eerily akin to many deep-pitched
voices.  If an instantaneous power, the sound grows in a heartbeat from
hardly noticeable to as loud as a shout, which can be heard within 100 feet.
If the power has an extended duration, the low hum persists within the
vicinity of the power (15 feet) until the duration expires.  Some powers may
describe unique auditory displays.</li>
<li>MA - Material: The subject or the area is briefly slicked with the
ephemeral translucent goo.  The slime evaporates after 1 round regardless of
the power's duration.  Sophisticated psions recognize the slime as
ectoplasmic seepage from the Astral Plane; this substance is utterly
inert.</li>
<li>ME - Mental: A ringing, like tiny bells, tingles within the minds of all
living creatures within 30 feet of the manifester or the subject while the
power remains in effect, unless a unique mental display is described.</li>
<li>OL - Olfactory: An odd but familiar odor bings to mind a brief mental
flash of a memory long buried.  The scent is difficult to pin down, and no
two individuals ever describe it the same way (to one creature the odor may
be akin to burning metal, while to her companion, honeysuckle).  The odor
originates from the manifester and spreads to a distance of 20 feet before
fading when the power's duration ends.</li>
<li>VI - Visual: The manifester's eyes burn like points of silver fire while
the power remains in effect, and an instaneous rainbow-flash of light sweeps
away from the manifester to a distance of 5 feet, unless a unique visual
secondary effect is described.</li>
</ul>

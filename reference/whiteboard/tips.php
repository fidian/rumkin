<p>My readers have submitted many different ideas and tips to me that relate
to whiteboards.  This is a list of the most useful ones.

<?php Section('Whiteboard Tips'); ?>

<p>I read on numerous pages to just use a sock to erase stuff because it
tends to scratch less than paper towels or miscellaneous things you find.  I
just use small hand towels that were sold as "work rags" that were quite
cheap and very fluffy.</p>

<p>You can use Vis-A-Vis overhead markers or wet erase markers on
whiteboards, if you want a slightly more permanent type of mark.  For
D&amp;D, you could draw walls with Vis-A-Vis markers, and people with
dry erase markers.  Move people by just erasing them.  Redo the walls 
with a damp cloth (sock?) and dry the board before drawing more.</p>

<p>Test first!  When you get a new dry erase board, try marking it in a
corner.  If that comes off, use several colors in that corner and see if
they all come off.  Try Vis-A-Vis.  When all done with those tests, try a
long-term test by marking the corner with each marker and waiting a day or
maybe a week.  Wipe and see if the markers stained the board.</p>

<p>If you do want to permanently mark your board, Sharpie permanent markers
may not do the trick.  The dry erase marker will act like a solvent and you
might end up wiping away your lines.  You can damage the board with a tiny
scratch from a knife point, and that will turn black because the whiteboard
marker flecks will get stuck in there and your eraser won't be able to clean
inside.  A deep enough scratch will expose the cardboard backing, and that
will get black in a hurry.  Also, you can use paint, but make the line as
thin as possible.  Paint won't let markers wipe off, so the lines will
eventually turn black.</p>
	
<p>Because dry erase markers act as a solvent, you can sometimes remove Sharpie
permanent marker marks by just drawing over them with a dry erase marker
and then wiping them both away.  In my tests, you might need to use the dry
erase marker a few times before you get the surface clean, but it often
will get rid of the permanent marker.</p>

<p>Whiteboards are very useful devices for many reasons.  I have used them
for fleshing out ideas, planning crafts, keeping track of lists, and using
them as maps for D&amp;D (the land, encounters, etc).  Downstairs, in my
"general purpose" room, I have a large 4' x 8' sheet of plywood that was
turned into a crude craft table.  I wanted a whiteboard on top.  I also do a
lot of sketching on my bedroom wall and my wife thinks that a whiteboard
would be very useful there.</p>

<p>This page is a chronicle of what we researched and tried in order to make
and maintain a large whiteboard.  I hope it helps other people out.</p>

<p>Basically, you need to pick out the best <a
href="surfaces.php">surface</a> for your particular application.  I have a
page that <a href="make.php">provides suggestions</a>.  Take some
time and research possibilities.  What you need may not be the same as what
I wanted.</p>

<p>For instance, a teacher getting a class of 3rd graders each their own
personal "whiteboard" could just be 30 <a href="make.php#laminate">laminated
pieces of tagboard</a>.  If you
want to coat the walls of your house and still have colors, you would want a
<a href="make.php#mb3000">coating</a> of some sort.  If you needed it on a
table surface or if you wanted to refurbish an existing whiteboard, you may 
need yet another type of product.</p>

<p>I have tried to rate as many types of surfaces as what I could get my
hands on, and I put them on their own <a href="surfaces.php">Surfaces</a>
page.  I have written up instructions on how to <a href="make.php">make a
whiteboard</a> for all of the surfaces that showed promise.</p>
   
<?php Section('Cleaning the Board'); ?>

<p>I have found numerous methods that people have used for cleaning a
whiteboard, and then web site visitors have submitted others.  I have tested
them all on a commercial whiteboard with numerous non-whiteboard things
added in, such as crayons and ink.  Check out the results on the <a
href="cleaners.php">Cleaners</a> page.</p>

<p>Once you find a nice cleaner, you can stick it in a spray bottle to have
it convenient for when you need to wipe off the board.</p>

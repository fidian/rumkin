Hyphenation
- Count number of lines that end in "[^-]-\n" versus total number of lines
- If over X %, remove them and assume hyphenation
- Otherwise, leave them (but not the newline/space) and assume soft 
  line breaking on hyphenated words
  
  
Proper Names
- To fix when A NAME is changed into <i>a name</i>, we make a file called
  proper.txt that will feed the capitalization fixes back into the text

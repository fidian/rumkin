<p>Over the years, I have been asked why I selected &quot;rumkin.com&quot; as my site&#39;s name. I repeatedly answer them with a fragment here and a sentence there. This page is a collection of everything rumkin-esque.</p><h2 id=the-hunt>The Hunt</h2><p>Before I registered my own domain name, I had a few rules in mind. I wanted it short, pronounceable, a word, non-offensive, and hard to screw up. I did not want anything with a number, symbol, nor anything that could be spelled multiple ways if I were to say the site name to someone. Things like &quot;4ever.com&quot; and &quot;be-good.com&quot; were instantly removed from consideration. I also wanted it to be 6 letters or fewer and I wanted a &quot;dot com&quot; ending because that&#39;s the fad at that time.</p><p>I wrote a program that took a wordlist and checked with DNS servers and various WHOIS servers in order to see if that domain was currently registered. This generated a list of possible domain names.</p><p>At that time (February 22, 2001), I was able to find a single 4 letter domain name: rynt.com. It did not satisfy my requirement of being pronounceable, and if I were to say &quot;rynt.com&quot; to people, they might try to type rint.com.</p><p>The search continued and 778 entries with 5 letters and 3791 with 6 letters. I painstakingly went through each entry by hand and proposed only the very best to my fianceé (who later became my wife). We settled on <code>rumkin.com</code> because when someone tells you the site name and you try to spell it, you usually get it right. Well, there are those that add a &quot;p&quot; in there, but there will always be someone that gets it wrong.</p><h2 id=other-rumkins>Other Rumkins</h2><p>I did not select this site&#39;s name because of Teddy Ruxpin, the Nickelodeon character Harold Rumkin, or even because of the definition. Sorry folks.</p><p>By the way, here&#39;s the definition in case you didn&#39;t already know it.</p><ul><li><strong>rumkin</strong> ( <em>rum&quot;kin</em> ) A popular or jocular name for a drinking vessel. <a href=http://dictionary.reference.com/ >source</a></li></ul><p>A Russian-speaking person emailed me and mentioned that ...</p><blockquote><p>Rumkin is a family name, formed from the word &quot;rumka&quot;<br>RUMKa (рюмка) is a small glass for strong drinks, like vodka</p></blockquote><p>If you really want to add &#39;rumkin&#39; to your vocabulary and not refer to this website, you probably would find an easier time using &quot;rummer,&quot; which also refers to the small glass. For example, &quot;Hey Bob! Fill me another rummer!&quot; sounds <em>way</em> better than &quot;Hey Bob! Fill me another rumkin.com!&quot;</p>

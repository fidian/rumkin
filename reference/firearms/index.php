<p>If you talk to a lot of gun enthusiasts, many different and often
conflicting opinions will be shared.  Each person has their own background,
reasoning, and justification for what they believe is the best.  However,
nearly everyone will agree on the following saying:</p>

<p align=center><font size="+1"><i>The bottom line is you want to hit well, 
hit deep enough,<br>
make a big hole, and not overpenetrate in that order.</i></font></p>
	
<?PHP Section('Hit Well'); ?>

<p>Obviously, that means you need to know your firearms and be able to use
them to accurately hit a target.  Practice.  Remember to be safe, use eye
and ear protection, make sure you follow the <a
href="http://www.remington.com/safety/10comm.htm">Ten Commandments of
Firearm Safety</a>.

<?PHP Section('Hit Deep Enough'); ?>

<p>You know if you are hitting deep enough by doing some sort of penetration
testing.  You need to be able to hit through the target to get into vital
organs.  If you don't do that, you might as well not shoot.

<?PHP Section('Make a Big Hole'); ?>

<p>Again, more penetration testing.  This time, you are looking for the size
of the track wound that the bullet produces.  More is better.

<?PHP Section('Don\'t Overpenetrate'); ?>

<p>It's more critical for cops than for other people, but ideally you
wouldn't want to shoot an intruder, have it go through your house and into a
neighbor's house, through their television, into another room, and into your
friendly neighbor.

<p>It also means that a .50 cal Desert Eagle is probably too much gun if you
are only concerned with home security.  But again, it is the last concern.
The .50 will certainly hit deep enough and make a big hole if you can wield
it properly and accurately.

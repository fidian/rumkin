Specifically, we were trying to find out if there was a 1:1 relationship from NYPVTT to BERLIN, or there was some other step, the masking technique. Jim was confused when we mentioned masking technique, evidently it&#39;s something that Ed said that Jim didn&#39;t understand. Jim said that yes the ciphertext and plaintext were connected, but when I tried to explain what exactly we were asking, like that in K1 EMUFPH is exactly BETWEE, but in K3 ENDYAH does not map exactly to SLOWLY, Jim backed off and said he would only commit to the fact that K4 is exactly 97 characters long, and that BERLIN is plaintext that starts at exactly the 64th character, but he wouldn&#39;t go further than that.</p></blockquote><p>The cipher method probably doesn&#39;t involve math. Sanborn admitted he&#39;s bad at math during <a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/01/30/801323608/a-new-and-final-clue-to-kryptos-a-long-standing-puzzle>an interview</a>, and had this to say at a different interview.</p><blockquote><p>And Ed basically gave me—he gave me a primer of ancient encoding systems. And he also gave me some ideas for contemporary coding systems, more sophisticated systems, systems that didn&#39;t necessarily depend on mathematics. That was one of my prerequisites. So he told me about matrix codes and things like that. These are the parts of Kryptos that have already been cracked. So I can discuss them. But he told me about coding systems that I could then modify in a myriad of ways. So that even he would not know what it says. Okay? So that was very seductive to me. And so I took those things. We met two or three times. And that&#39;s what I based the whole thing on.</p></blockquote><h2 id=threads>Threads</h2><div class=Ta(c)><a href=compass.jpg><img src=compass-small.jpg alt=Compass></a><br>Images copyright Jim Gillogly, 1999, and mirrored from [his website](http://www.voynich.net/Kryptos/).</div><p><code>EASTNORTHEAST</code> is the same direction as the compass etched into a stone located in the same area as the bent metal shape that most consider to be Kryptos.

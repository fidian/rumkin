<p>Programmers should strive to make their code run fast when possible. The exact same result in JavaScript can take vastly different amounts of time when achieved by different means.</p><h2 id=dereferencing>Dereferencing</h2><p>If you are looking at <code>document.my_form.some_input_element.value</code> often, it will be best to store the value to a local variable. A visitor to my site pointed out that my code would be sped up by a factor of 10 if I used this particular change. He was absolutely right.</p><pre><code>// Avoid
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i ++) {
    a = document.testform.testtext.value;
    b = document.testform.testtext.value.length;
    c = document.testform.testtext.value.substr(2, 1);
}

// Faster
v = document.testform.testtext.value;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i ++) {
    a = v;
    b = v.length;
    c = v.substr(2, 1);
}
</code></pre><p>Internet Explorer usually provided me with a 20-25x speed increase, but sometimes it plummeted down to a mere 4 or 5x speed increase. No matter what, it is clear that it is far faster to use a local variable.</p><h2 id=string-concatenation>String Concatenation</h2><p>One other tip that I get a lot is that I should avoid lots of little string concatenations. I also read that string concatenations get worse with the size of the string being concatenated. Instead, the little substrings should be placed into an array and then joined together to make one big string in the end.</p><pre><code>// Normal concatenation
a = &#39;&#39;;
b = &#39;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#39;;
b += &#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&#39;;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 500; i ++) {
    a += b + b + b + b + b;
}

// Using an Array
a = [];
b = &#39;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#39;;
b += &#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&#39;;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 500; i ++) {
    a.push(b);
    a.push(b);
    a.push(b);
    a.push(b);
    a.push(b);
}
a = a.join(&#39;&#39;);
</code></pre><p>Older versions of Internet Explorer gets another huge boost with this one. Other browsers run these both equally and Firefox actually may run it slower as an array. Chrome is faster when you deal with strings directly. The size of the strings matter greatly and longer strings typically make the speed boost worth something.</p><h2 id=additional-resources>Additional Resources</h2><ul><li><a href=http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/efficient-javascript/ >Efficient JavaScript</a> - Tips from the developers of Opera on how to write good code.</li><li><a href=https://tecnocode.co.uk/2006/11/25/javascript-string-concatenation/ >JavaScript String Concatenation</a> - Shows how string concatenation is slow and the use of <code>Array.join()</code> can save you lots of time.</li></ul>

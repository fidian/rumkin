<p>This is a display based on Conway&#39;s game of life / cellular automata. It has very simple rules. Start with a board. Then check each area. If the area has no current cell and there are three or more adjacent cells, a new cell is created. If the area has a cell and less than two or more than three adjacent living cells, it dies (starvation / overpopulation).</p><p>This page starts with a smile in the center and random blobs everywhere else. You can see where new cells are created, when they die, etc. Every few seconds a blob of some sort is splattered onto the game board. This should shake things up by knocking around living stable structures and creating more nodes for living clusters.</p><div class="module Jc(c)"></div><table><tr><td width=25%><div class="cell cell-fixed state0"></div>Empty</td><td width=25%><div class="cell cell-fixed state1"></div>New Cell</td><td width=25%><div class="cell cell-fixed state2"></div>Living Cell</td><td width=25%><div class="cell cell-fixed state3"></div>Dying Cell</td></tr></table>

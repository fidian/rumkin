<p>A &quot;favicon&quot; is a type of icon used for shortcuts. This little image is usually shown in the address bar when you are visiting a website and sometimes in bookmarks or favorites. It is a good idea to always have a favicon defined so your web server isn&#39;t pummeled for hits for a nonexistent image.</p><p>Some browsers let you use <code>.gif</code> files or <code>.png</code>, but to be completely safe and have all browsers see your picture, you should use a <code>.ico</code> file. The words &quot;SHORTCUT ICON&quot; are not case-sensitive (you are able to use lowercase if you want). Also, you can use a relative address instead of a fully qualified URL.</p><p>Use just one of these, whichever one looks like what you want.</p><pre><code>&lt;!-- Example #1 --&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;SHORTCUT ICON&quot; href=&quot;http://your.site.com/the_icon.ico&quot;&gt;

&lt;!-- Example #2 --&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;/my_icon.ico&quot;&gt;
</code></pre><p>If you do not define one, many browsers just automatically fetch <code>/favicon.ico</code> in the hopes that they will find one.</p>

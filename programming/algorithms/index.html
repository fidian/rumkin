<p>This page is devoted to the various algorithms that I have collected over the years. Here, you will find a description of the algorithm, what it is used for, links to code that I wrote and related off-site links. I like to keep things organized, so pick your favorite topic below:</p><ul><li><p><a href=escaping-encoding/ >String Escaping and Encoding</a> - Discussion on the topic of properly escaping strings when converting from one language or system to another. Some code examples are included.</p></li><li><p><a href=fuzzy-strings/ >Fuzzy String Matching</a> - How to determine the degree of similarity for two different strings. I cover Levenshtein&#x27;s and Oliver&#x27;s methods along with soundex.</p></li><li><p><a href=linked-list/ >Doubly Linked Lists</a> - Interesting idea (backed with code) about how you can save memory by using XOR to store the difference between the previous and next nodes in the list.</p></li></ul>

Security considerations:

Non-authenticated users should not see
 * Groups marked as private
 * Images marked as private
 * Images that are only in groups that are marked as private
 * Orphans

To make things quicker, group parents are not checked.  This means that if
you have a public group in a private group, the public group could be
visible to non-authenticated users.  Likewise, public pictures in public
groups in private groups (that's a mouthful) could be found with searching
and can be viewed.

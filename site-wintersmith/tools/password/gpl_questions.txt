Hello,

Please accept our apologies for the delay in getting back to you. We
rely on volunteer effort and often have difficulties keeping up with
the demand for our expertise.

If the data is required in order to make the software work, then it is
what the terms of the GPL call "Corresponding Source": 

"The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
those activities."

Therefore the data needs to be licensed under the terms of the GPL, and
provided as an integral part of the software. 

If you are the sole copyright holder of the entire software, then this
isn't a GPL violation, but it makes the software non-free in practice,
even though it is distributed under the terms of the GPL.

But note that if any general data would do, then you are not required to
distribute your data with the software. For example, you can distribute
a GPLed image viewer without any images. This is because the image is
not special, particular or specific to the image viewer, any image would
do just as well. 

Contrast this with, for example, tables of specific data a piece of
software needs to do its primary function.

No, the GPL does not require that. I'm not familiar with how your
software work well enough to tell if lacking that feature would or would
not collide with any of the requirements in the GPL.

If you could provide a way for anyone to generate the corresponding data
needed in the previous question, so that it could be used in the same
manner and for the same purpose, then there wouldn't be a problem.

I hope my answers are of help. If you need further assistance, please do
not hesitate to ask. Thank you for working on releasing software under
the terms of the GPL.

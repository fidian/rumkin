<P>Did you ever want to play a puzzle on your web page, or put one on to
entertain others? This applet is probably just what you want. It was inspired
by a CGI script which essentially did the same thing, but not nearly as fast
(especially on a 14.4 modem). Right now, people who play the puzzle only have
to download the applet (only about 14k), download the image, and download any
optional sound to play when you solve the puzzle.</P> 

<P>If you think these two puzzles don't work, please try to make sure that
you have Java enabled in your browser. This puzzle relies upon it. If you still
experience problems, please make sure to e-mail me about it (my address is at
the bottom), and please include as much detail as possible.</P>

<P>This puzzle (without modifications) is freeware. I will not charge for
this version, and I will not charge for future versions. With any version
of the puzzle I write, it is free to be used by anyone. I do not require a
link from your puzzle page. You can generate money using the puzzle and
you are not obliged to pay me. I accept donations, if you feel the need 
to pay someone.  You do not need my permission to use this program -- I have
already given it.</P>

<P>Java source to the puzzle <i>is</i> 
<a href="media/puzzle.java">available</a>. This applet should be
simple enough for people who know Java to program, or for semi-talented
beginners to start with.</p>

<p>I have not had the time to implement many things into the software, and
instead of having people continue to wait for the features, I have decided
to abandon the project.  Because I will no longer maintain the software,
your requests for features will fall upon deaf ears.  However, if you do
actually change the program, I ask that you submit your changes back so
others can benefit from your work.</p>

After searching the results from htmlzip and "hc_decoder" (not sure where
that was found), the following characters are not used in the encoded data.

I am a bit curious why 141, 143, 144, and 157 are skipped.

null 0x00
backspace 0x08
form feed? 0x0C
newline 0x0D
carriage return 0x0A
tab? 0x09
vertical tab? 0x0B
backslash 0x5C
single quote? 0x27
double quote 0x22

i` 141 0x8D
A* 143 0x8F
E/ 144 0x90
Y= 157 0x9D

I might suggest 0x20 through 0x7E, skipping 0x22 ("), 0x5C (\), resulting in
93 chars.  Then add in tab (0x09), ... and more?

160-163 (not sure why I mentioned this set of numbers)

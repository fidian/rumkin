Installation

  Requirements
  
     * A web server.
     * [36]php4 with the following modules:
          + ftp
          + mcrypt (optional)
     * Settings required in php.ini
          + register_globals=on
          + file_uploads=on
     * ftp server
          + CHMOD support by the ftp server is required for the changing
            of permissions to work.

  Unpacking the files
  
   Extract the weeblefm tar archive to a folder that is accessible to
   your web server. For example:
cd /usr/local/www/data/
tar -zxvf /path/to/weeblefm-1.1.tar.gz

   This will create a folder called "weeblefm" where the files are
   stored, you may rename this if you choose to. Using the above example,
   the files would be located in:
/usr/local/www/data/weeblefm/

  Configuration
  
   To configure the Weeble File Manager, open the settings.php file in
   your favorite editor.

   For a quick setup, all of the options are documented in that file.
   More detailed descriptions of what the options are, and their possible
   settings, can be found later on in this documentation.

   The only setting that you must set before WeebleFM will work is the
   $ftp_Servers variable.

  Usage
  
   Once settings.php has been edited to your liking, simply open your web
   browser and point it to where ever WeebleFM resides on your server. In
   the above example, we would direct our browser to
   http://www.webserver.dom/weeblefm/

  Introduction
  
    What is Weeble File Manager?
    
   WeebleFM is a web-based file manager based on php4 and ftp. Our
   intention is to create an OS independent file manager. While based
   upon FTP, WeebleFM is not limited to ftp, and we are working to create
   a full feature file manager.

    How do I install it?
    
   See the [37]Installation section at the top of this document.

    Layout Descriptions
    
      Directory
      
   Clicking any of the directory links will change to that directory.
   Clicking the radio button to the left will select that directory for
   one of the functions listed at the bottom.

      File Information
      
   Listed here is the following:
     * File/directory ownership (user:group).
     * Last modification date and time.
     * File/directory size.

      Files
      
   Clicking any of the files will download that file (See
   [41]Downloading). Clicking the radio button to the left will select
   that file for one of the functions listed at the bottom.

      Help
      
   Click Help to bring up this page.

      Home Directory
      
   Clicking this link will take you back to your home directory.

      Login Information
      
   Displays the username and the server name that the user logged in to.

      Logout
      
   Click Logout to log out of the file manager.

      Up One Directory
      
   Clicking this link will change to the parent of the current directory.

  Features
  
    Logging In
    
      Username & Password
      
   To login to WeebleFM, type your username and password.

      Server
      
   Next you choose the server you wish to login to by selecting it from
   the Server dropdown list.

      Login
      
   Once your username and password are filled in, and the server is
   selected, click Login to log into the server.

      Remember Me
      
   Check this box to have WeebleFM save your username and password in a
   browser cookie. The next time you return to the login scree, the
   username and password will already be filled in.

      Remove Login Cookie
      
   If you no longer want your username and password saved (as a cookie),
   click this link.

    Changing Directories
    
   There are two ways to change directories in WeebleFM. The first is to
   type a path into the "Current Directory" section at the top and click
   the CD button.

   The second is to click on a directory name in the main file listing.
   There are two special "directory" entries that are always displayed at
   the top of the file listing. Those are the ". (home directory)" and
   ".. (up one directory)".

   . (home directory)
          This will always take you back to your home directory.

   .. (up one directory)
          This will change to the parent of your current working
          directory.

    Creating Files and Directories
    
   Both new files and directories are easy to create. Simply select
   whether you want to create a File or Directory, type in the name, and
   click Create.

   When creating a new directory it will be placed in the current working
   directory.

   When creating a new file, you will be taken immediately into the
   editor. You must click Save for the new file to be created. See the
   section on [42]Editing Files for more information on how to use the
   editor.

    Editing Files
    
   WeebleFM has a built in text editor. To edit a file, choose one of the
   files in the current directory, by clicking the radio button to the
   left of it's name, and click the Edit button.

   The layout of the editor window is very similar to the directory
   listing:
     * At the top will be listed the "Current File" instead of the
       "Current Directory", which lists the file loaded into the editor.
     * Directly to the right of the current file is a Cancel button.
       Click this button to discard your changes and return to the file
       listing.
     * Below the current file is the edit box. Make any changes to the
       file here.
     * At the bottom are four buttons:
          + Save will save your changes and return to the file listing.
          + Save & Edit will save your changed and return to editing the
            current file.
          + Preview will load your current changes into a separate
            preview frame. Changes will not be saved until one of the two
            save buttons are clicked.
          + Reset will discard your changes but stay in the editor.

   Please note: The editor will be unable to save a file once the session
   has expired. If you have problems with loosing your changes, either
   save the files more frequently, or have the system administrator
   increase session.cache_expire in php.ini.

    Delete
    
   To delete a file or directory, select the file or directory by
   clicking the radio button to it's left and click the Delete button.
   Directories can only be deleted if they are empty.

    Copy
    
   Only files can be copied. To copy a file, select the file by clicking
   the radio button to it's left and click Copy. Next select the folder
   to copy the file to and click Commit. You can select any directory you
   have access to save a file to.

   If the file name already exists in the destination folder, the words
   "Copy of" will be append to the beginning of the name.

    Move
    
   Both files and directories can be moved. Select the file or directory
   by clicking the radio button to it's left and click Move. Next select
   the folder to move to and click Commit.

    Rename
    
   Both files and directories can be renamed. Select the file or
   directory by clicking the radio button to it's left, type in a new
   name at the bottom next to the Rename button, and then click the
   Rename button.

    Upload
    
   To upload a file click the Browse... button at the bottom, select a
   file, and then click the Upload button.

   To upload multiple files at one time, click the Upload button without
   1st selecting a file. This will take you to the Upload page. Here you
   can select multiple files to upload at one time.

    Download
    
   To download a file simply click on the filename.

    Show/Hide
    
   The Show/Hide buttons toggle the display of hidden files. Click Show
   to display hidden files. Click Hide to hide them.

    Permissions
    
   On systems that support the CHMOD command, the individual file
   permissions can be changed. The permissions are displayed to the far
   right of each file or directory. Below is an example of the
   permissions on a directory:

     drwxr-xr-x

   Click on the permission you wish to change to toggle it. For more
   information on how file permissions work, see the permissions entry in
   the [43]Glossary.

    Preferences
    
   The Preferences window allows you to customize Weeble File Manager, if
   the system administrator has enabled this feature. (See $allow_custom
   in [44]Configuration Options.)

   The available configuration options are grouped into 3 categories:
     * [45]Preset Theme
     * [46]Display
     * [47]Miscellaneous

      Preset Theme
      
   A number of preset themes are available with Weeble File Manager that
   change its look (colors, fonts, font sizes, etc...). Select a theme
   from the list and click Load Theme to see what it looks like.

   Click Save to keep this theme, or click Cancel to discard your
   changes.

   Note: Once a theme is loaded, it'll stay active even if Cancel is
   clicked. Logging out and back in will restore the user's previous
   settings.

      Display
      
   The Display preferences are very similar to the themes. Here you can
   customize the colors, background image(s), fonts, and font sizes to
   you own liking. The display preferences are broken down again, into 3
   categories.
     * Page - These settings effect the whole page.
     * File Manager - These settings effect the file listing display.
     * Misc. - Miscellaneous display settings.

        Color References
        
     * Douglas R. Jacobson's [48]RGB Color Chart
     * [49]HTMLHelp.Org Color Units

   Click Preview to view your changes, Save to keep them, or Cancel to
   discard.

      Miscellaneous
      
   Miscellaneous preferences are any settings that don't fit in the other
   two categories. Currently they consist of:

   Starting Directory
   Set this to the directory (folder) WeebleFM should start in, when
   logging in. If this is blank, the default is to log into your home
   directory.

   Hidden Files
   Controls whether to initially display hidden files when logging in.

   Edit Box
   Controls the height (in rows) and width (in columns) of the edit
   window, and the size (in either pixels or a percentage) of the preview
   window.

  Configuration Options
  
   All of WeebleFM's configuration options can be found in the
   settings.php file. In this section we'll list each configuration
   variable, what it's purpose is, and what the available settings are.

    $allow_chmod
    
      Example: $allow_chmod = TRUE;
      
   Setting this to TRUE will allow the user to change file permissions
   (if supported by the server).

    $allow_custom
    
      Example: $allow_custom = FALSE;
      
   Setting this to TRUE will allow the user to override the default
   preferences.

    $def_Display_Hidden
    
      Example: $def_Display_Hidden = FALSE;
      
   Default setting for the display of hidden files and directories.

    $default_theme
    
      Example: $default_theme = "default";
      
   Default theme for the file manager. Set this to the name of the theme
   in the "themes/" directory you want to be the default (without the
   .thm extension).

   This effects the theme used on the login page, and the theme chosen
   for new users who do not yet have one set. If $allow_custom = FALSE,
   this will be the theme used for all users.

    $editor_prefs
    
      Example:
      $editor_prefs = array (
      "rows" => 20,
      "cols" => 80,
      "max_size" => 50000,
      "preview_size" => "25%",
      "allow_html" => TRUE,
      "html_ext" => "html htm"
      );
      
   Settings used by the file editor.
     * rows = Width of the edit box.
     * cols = height of the edit box.
     * max_size = Maximum file size allowed by the file editor (in
       bytes).
     * preview_size = Size of the Preview frame. This can either be a
       percentage or a size in pixels.
     * allow_html = TRUE to allow HTML tags in the preview frame. FALSE
       to display everything as plain text.
     * html_ext = A space separated list of extensions that are to be
       treated as HTML files by the Editor Preview.

    $ftp_access
    
      Example: $ftp_access = TRUE;
      
   This sets the default access to WeebleFM. When a remote client is not
   covered by any of the entries in $ftp_access_list, this variable
   determines whether they are allowed access.

   Set to TRUE to allow access by default, FALSE to deny.

    $ftp_access_list
    
      Example:
      $ftp_access_list = array (
      "-172.16.10.8/255.255.255.255",
      "+172.17.45.1/24"
      );
      
   Access list to allow or deny access to WeebleFM. Syntax is as follows:
   [+,-]IP/MASK

   Note: Some versions of php4 choke on "255.255.255.255", in those cases
   please use "/32" instead.

   +,- + allows access, - denies access.
   IP The IP can be specified in dotted-quad (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) notation
   or as a hostname (www.example.com).
   Mask The (subnet) mask can be specified in dotted-quad
   (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) notation or in /CERN (e.g. /24) notation.

    $ftp_disable_mcrypt
    
      Example: $ftp_disable_mcrypt = FALSE;
      
   Set this to TRUE if you absolutely must disable the mcrypt encryption
   support. Setting this introduces security issues as anyone who has
   access to the web server can potentially read the stored passwords.
   The only time this should be set is when mcrypt is unavailable.

    $ftp_max_uploads
    
      Example: $ftp_max_uploads = 5;
      
   Set this to the maximum number of files a user can upload at one time,
   on the multiple-upload page.

    $ftp_Passive_Mode
    
      Example: $ftp_Passive_Mode = FALSE;
      
   Set this to TRUE if you want/need to use passive mode ftp connections
   to your server.

    $ftp_remember_me
    
      Example: $ftp_remember_me = TRUE;
      
   Set this to TRUE to enable the Remember Me checkbox, FALSE to disable.

    $ftp_Servers
    
      Example: $ftp_Servers = array (
      "Server Name" => "localhost:21",
      "Another Server" => "server2:8021"
      );
      
   Set this to the ftp server(s) you would like available to your users.
   The format is "Descriptive Name" => "server:port". The descriptive
   name is what will be listed on the Login screen, Server is the
   hostname or ip address of the ftp server, and Port is the port the ftp
   server is listening on. If the port is not specified the default of 21
   will be used.

    $icon_display
    
      Example:
      $icon_display = array (
      "dirup"=> "dirup.gif",
      "dir"=> "dir.gif",
      "file"=> "binary.gif",
      "php"=> "php.gif"
      );
      
   Icons used for different file types, set by file extension. The
   default settings are:
     * dirup = Icon used for the 'up' directory link.
     * dir = Icon used for directories.
     * file = Default icon used for files.
     * php = An example of the file extension support. All files ending
       in .php will use this icon.

    $key
    
      Example: $key = "WEEBLEFM";
      
   Key used for the encryption in WeebleFM (passwords, etc...). This
   should be unique to your site. Also, if this changes, the
   username/password cookies will need to be re-saved.

    $log
    
      $log = array(
      "dir" => "/tmp",
      "filename" => "wfm.log",
      "level" => 0
      );
      
   Set this up to configure logging.
     * dir = Directory where the log will be stored.
     * filename = Filename of the log.
     * level = Level of information that will be displayed in the log.
          + 0 = No logging.
          + 1 = Logins.
          + 2 = Logins and errors.

   Note: If file / directory where weeblefm is logging needs to be
   writable by the web server, otherwise logging will fail.

    $logo
    
      Example: $logo = "logo.gif";
      
   Set this to the location of the logo graphic displayed at the top of
   WeebleFM.

    $logo_anim
    
      Example: $logo_anim = "logo.gif";
      
   Set this to the location of the logo graphic displayed at the top of
   the login page.

    $pref_ciphers
    
      Example: $pref_ciphers = array ("rijndael-256", "tripledes", "blowfish",
      "des");
      
   This lists the preferred encryption algorithms provided by the mcrypt
   support, they are listed in order of preference. If the 1st option
   isn't available, it attempts to use the second. If none of the listed
   algorithms are available, the script will default to whatever is
   available.

    $show_col
    
      $show_col = array(
      "owner" => TRUE,
      "date" => TRUE,
      "size" => TRUE,
      "perm" => TRUE
      );
      
   This variable allows the admin to choose what columns to display in
   the file manager listing.
     * owner: User and group ownership.
     * date: Date & time last modified.
     * size: Size of the file.
     * perm: Permissions of the file/directory. (See Permissions in the
       [50]Glossary)

    $warn_color
    
      Example:
      $warn_color = array (
      "info" => "#000000",
      "minor" => "#000055",
      "medium" => "#555599",
      "major" => "#FF0000"
      );
      
   Color settings for the different levels of warning messages.

    Limiting Uploads
    
   There are two settings in php.ini that must be configured to set the
   file size upload limitations. See the [55]HelpDesk for more
   information.
     * upload_max_filesize
     * post_max_size

    Creating/Editing Themes
    
   The themes are loaded from files ending in .thm, in the themes/
   directory. Two simple ways to create a theme are.
    1. Copy the Default.thm to a new file (e.g. MyTheme.thm), and edit
       the file. Each option is commented as to what it is for.
    2. Use the Preferences window to create a personal theme. Once you
       are satisfied with it, copy your .wfmrc to the themes/ directory
       and rename it (e.g. MyTheme.thm). Edit your new .thm file and
       remove any lines that do not start with "thm_".

Glossary

   Passive Mode
          Directly from bsd FTP manual pages: 

          The PASV command requests that the remote server open a port
          for the data connection and return the address of that port.
          The remote server listens on that port and the client connects
          to it.

          When using the more traditional PORT command, the client
          listens on a port and sends that address to the remote server,
          who connects back to it. Passive mode is useful when using ftp
          through a gateway router or host that controls the
          directionality of traffic. (Note that though ftp servers are
          required to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do not.)

   Permissions
          There are 3 sets of permissions for every file or directory --
          owner, group, and world. For each set, there are separate read
          (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions. The owner
          permissions are for the owner of the file or directory. The
          group permissions are for everyone in the group. The world
          permissions are for anyone else.

          Using the earlier example of drwxr-xr-x we have three sets of
          permissions.

          drwxr-xr-x - Owner permissions.
          drwxr-xr-x - Group permissions.
          drwxr-xr-x - World permissions.

   Subnet Mask
          A subnet mask is used to determine what IP network an IP
          address belongs to, or if two IPs are on the same network. A
          subnet mask can be expressed in two ways, in dotted-quad
          (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) notation, or in /XX shorthand.

          For more information on subnetting try this [56]Google Search.

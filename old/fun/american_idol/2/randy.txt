You're just [Ok].
It was just [Ok].
I thought that you at least brought something interesting to it.

There were a couple of little pitch problems for me in the beginning and at
the end.
A little pitchy in the beginning, dropped a couple notes, but you're \
probably really nervous, right?
I just haven't been blown away.
It was good, but it's like, nothing has been, "Oh my God!"
When we're trying to find the best that we can find in America, I just feel
like it is falling a little short tonight.
It's all parts of good, but not like amazing.
I'm just going to say no.
I don't understand what is going on tonight.
It was definately interesting.  [Randy stifles a laugh.]
It just was [Bad Adj], [Dude].  [^Bad Adj].  [^Bad Adj].

I thought it was [Good Adj].

You brought something different to the song.
I liked the run at the end.
I was waiting for you to do something ... you did something.  So, I'm \
[Good Adj].
I'm all [Good Adj].
It was a very interesting choice of song for me.
It was the most passion I've seen all night from a vocalist.
I actually liked it.
I liked it, [Dude].
I don't know what quite to do with that, but I liked it.

You sang strong, had some conviction going on.
You definately can sing.
Wow!  I love this!

!Ok
alright

!Bad Adj
terrible

You're just not really cut out to be a singer, I don't think.
You're tone deaf.  You couldn't even hear those notes.  You didn't even \
know what those notes were.  You could sing that song fifteen times, being \
in the hot sun, you still wouldn't get it right.
I think that you've got a good voice.
You just don't have the talent to be a singer.  You have to start with some \
talent.  Terrible.  Awful.
You can't sing.
There was nothing special about it for me.  Sorry.  It's good though.
My God!  I've been waiting for that for the last 4 days!
Nice voice.
Good voice.  A little Broadway, a little theatre for me with the vibrato, \
but I liked it.
I've got one phrase for you:  Don't sing ever, anymore.
Stop singing.  Please.
Singing is not for you.
*stunned silence*
Good dancing, good perfoming.  Not good singing for me.
Very, very good.
I absolutely loved you.  I think you've got the whole package.
I love the outfit, but listen dude.  About the vocals, they're just not good \
enough, man.
We gave you a chance to sing.  It just wasn't good enough, dog.
Excellent, dude.  One of the best I've heard today.  Excellent.
Excellent.  Very good.
Are you a little nervous?  It was a pretty good performance.  A little \
sharp at the end.  There's just something about the way that you were \
singing that was just throwing me off a little bit.
It was a very tough song to sing, and we are looking for unbelievable.  \
I didn't see any unbelievable emotion.  And singing a song with all that in \
it and you are singing it without any emotion, I'm like, "Where's the \
connection between you and the song?"
The song was cool.  You just didn't perform it that good.
Half the notes you didn't quite hit.
I didn't think that this was really quite the right song.
It was almost like you were kinda shouting it almost.  Know what I mean?
I don't know man.  It didn't quite work.
Very beautiful, you look great.  My biggest complaint with you is that I \
just didn't feel anything from you, performance wise.  From the face.  You \
just felt like you were stoic, and just standing in place, singing this song.
Finally a good singer, singing a song that is perfect.
Very beautiful.  You look amazing.
It's now working for me dude.  I don't know, man.
Good job dude!
Sensational!  Sensational!
Great song.
It was a tough song for me.  I didn't love the song on you.
Right song for the right guy.  Did your thing.  Did your homework.  I love \
that.
I guess I was waiting and hoping for a little more growth in the emotion \
area, in connecting with us.
I love the song, and I can tell that you were a bit nervous too.
I'm not sure that was ther right song for you.  It just didn't quite \
do you justice.  I still was not really moved by it.  It didn't work for me.
I didn't enjoy it at all.  We're trying to find the best.
I like it.
You started off a little bit shaky, you're probably a little nervous, but at
the end, I was like a'ight, you know what?  She's not bad.  She's a'ight.
It was ok.
You brought it home.
You did your thing.  Great.  Very nice.  Very nice.
Dude, that was terrible, man.  You shouldn't be singing.  Really.
You've got a good voice, you can sing, you've got a good look, you've got \
a great personality, but you just didn't sing any of the melody.
It's painful.  It sounds like you are in pain.
Wow.  You have a bunch of voices.  You were doing a kind of ventrilouist \
thing.  [Randy makes some garbled noises to imitate your singing.]
Have you ever been on a farm?  Heard sheep trying to sing?  Baa-aaa-aaa-aaa.
You have a really good voice.  You can sing.
Thank you God.
I think that you have a nice voice.  I think you've got the beginning of \
something.
Singing ain't where it's at dog.  You were at every key on that song. \
Every known key.  Terrible.  You just need to be able to sing in tune \
if you're going to sing any song.  And that was way out of tune.
I think it helps that you have a nice tone in your voice.  I thought it was \
good.
You don't have a bad voice.  The problem is that you way, way overdid it.  \
And the runs ... It's not about the runs.  It's really about the tone of the \
voice.  That's what sells people.  Just singing in tune and being good.  \
But you don't have a bad voice.  You actually have a nice sounding voice.
That was like really bad boy band.
Dude, I can't take it.  That's gotta be up there with the worst I've ever \
heard.
I don't think you're for Hollywood.  I don't think this is the kind of thing \
for you, at least not for American Idol.
You can sing.
I thought your voice was excellent.  Very, very good, and I think it's only \
going to go and get better in this competition.
I thought it was excellent.
That was horriffic, man.
Very good voice.
It sounded good.  Very nice.
Very nice.  Good.
You had me smiling.  You have such control.  Very interesting.
You can definately sing.
You sounded good.  I think you just gotta learn how to perform a bit \
better.  I really do.
I just think you chose the wrong song and it wasn't your best performance.
Dude, it sounds like, to me, like this song you were always just a little \
under the note.  I did not like the performance.
I thought it was good.  It wasn't great.
[Standing ovation.]  Finally, somebody bringing it, singing with passion, \
with conviction, in tune, the way singing is supposed to happen!  Finally! \
Yes!  Thank you!
Sang amazing.  Once again, an amazing, amazing performance.  You had the \
control.  This was like a master class in singing for me.  Really, really \
good.  I feel like this competition just started.
It was just a'ight.  I wasn't really with it.
A song like this is hard for you to do your runs and your rifts and show \
more of your vocal personality.  But you did your thing.  You did your thing.
You actually did a good job, man.  It was good, dog, it was good.  It was \
good.
Yo, yo, man.  It was a'ight.  It wasn't the best I've seen you, but it was \
a'ight.
Love the attitude, love the energy.  Singing well.  Tried to rock it out a \
little bit.  The crowd's loving it.  I felt it.
You were very good, man.  I felt your personality.  You sang well.  I was \
impressed, dog.  Very nice.
That was good, man.
That was good for me.
You didn't overdo it, you did your thing.
Brilliant, baby.
I like the vibe.  You had some little pitch problems with the song, but it \
was a'ight.
Very good.  Some of the most originality I've heard all night.  You gotta \
bring something else to these songs, and you definately did.
Excellent, dog.  I love your voice.  You brought something different to the \
song.  You felt like you've been singing this song forever, dog.  Very good.
It's the sound of your voice.  As soon as you sang the first three notes, \
I was like, "Man, this guy's dope!"
You look like you were having fun up there, man.  I was liking it.  I was \
feeling it.
I like you, I like your voice.  I did not love that song on you, dog.  Did \
not work for me, man.
You were a little pitchy, you had some problems there.  I don't know if I \
was completely overwhelmed by it, but it was a'ight.
That was really good.  You tried to make it your own, and I know you \
definately made it your own.
You didn't oversing the song.  You had great control, your voice sounds \
great.  I was very impressed.
I don't know.  Dude, I don't know if I really so thrilled with all that.  \
You had some pitch problems and stuff.  I feel like tonight's the start of \
a bad wedding reception.  I got a feeling about tonight.  I don't know, dog.
I'm just feeling very karoke tonight about all of this.  It was just allright.
I hated the arrangement of the song, but I loved you on it because you sang \
in tune.  You did your thing.  You were stellar, considering the arrangement.
Yeah, yeah, dog.  That's how you do it, dog.  That's how you do it right \
there.  No matter what it is, make it your own.  That was brilliant, dog.
You had some pitch problems, but I thought it was good.
That was great, man.
Brilliant.  Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant, dog.
I think that's probably ... you must have a cold or something because that \
wasn't your best performance, dog.

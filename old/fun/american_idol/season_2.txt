You're just [Ok].
It was just [Ok].
I thought that you at least brought something interesting to it.

There were a couple of little pitch problems for me in the beginning and at
the end.
A little pitchy in the beginning, dropped a couple notes, but you're \
probably really nervous, right?
I just haven't been blown away.
It was good, but it's like, nothing has been, "Oh my God!"
When we're trying to find the best that we can find in America, I just feel
like it is falling a little short tonight.
It's all parts of good, but not like amazing.
I'm just going to say no.
I don't understand what is going on tonight.
It was definately interesting.  [Randy stifles a laugh.]
It just was [Bad Adj], [Dude].  [^Bad Adj].  [^Bad Adj].

You brought something different to the song.
I liked the run at the end.
I was waiting for you to do something ... you did something.  So, I'm \
[Good Adj].
I'm all [Good Adj].
It was a very interesting choice of song for me.
It was the most passion I've seen all night from a vocalist.
I actually liked it.
I liked it, [Dude].
I don't know what quite to do with that, but I liked it.

You sang strong, had some conviction going on.
You definately can sing.
Wow!  I love this!

!Ok
alright

!Bad Adj
terrible

You're just not really cut out to be a singer, I don't think.
You're tone deaf.  You couldn't even hear those notes.  You didn't even \
know what those notes were.  You could sing that song fifteen times, being \
in the hot sun, you still wouldn't get it right.
I think that you've got a good voice.
You just don't have the talent to be a singer.  You have to start with some \
talent.  Terrible.  Awful.
You can't sing.
There was nothing special about it for me.  Sorry.  It's good though.
My God!  I've been waiting for that for the last 4 days!
Nice voice.
Good voice.  A little Broadway, a little theatre for me with the vibrotta, \
but I liked it.
I've got one phrase for you:  Don't sing ever, anymore.
Stop singing.  Please.
Singing is not for you.
*stunned silence*
Good dancing, good perfoming.  Not good singing for me.
Very, very good.
I absolutely loved you.  I think you've got the whole package.
I love the outfit, but listen dude.  About the vocals, they're just not good \
enough, man.
We gave you a chance to sing.  It just wasn't good enough, dog.
Excellent, dude.  One of the best I've heard today.  Excellent.
Excellent.  Very good.
Are you a little nervous?  It was a pretty good performance.  A little \
sharp at the end.  There's just something about the way that you were \
singing that was just throwing me off a little bit.
It was a very tough song to sing, and we are looking for unbelievable.  \
I didn't see any unbelievable emotion.  And singing a song with all that in \
it and you are singing it without any emotion, I'm like, "Where's the \
connection between you and the song?"
The song was cool.  You just didn't perform it that good.
Half the notes you didn't quite hit.
I didn't think that this was really quite the right song.
It was almost like you were kinda shouting it almost.  Know what I mean?
I don't know man.  It didn't quite work.
Very beautiful, you look great.  My biggest complaint with you is that I \
just didn't feel anything from you, performance wise.  From the face.  You \
just felt like you were stoic, and just standing in place, singing this song.
Finally a good singer, singing a song that is perfect.
Very beautiful.  You look amazing.
It's now working for me dude.  I don't know, man.
Good job dude!
Sensational!  Sensational!
Great song.
It was a tough song for me.  I didn't love the song on you.
Right song for the right guy.  Did your thing.  Did your homework.  I love \
that.
I guess I was waiting and hoping for a little more growth in the emotion \
area, in connecting with us.
I love the song, and I can tell that you were a bit nervous too.
I'm not sure that was ther right song for you.  It just didn't quite \
do you justice.  I still was not really moved by it.  It didn't work for me.
I didn't enjoy it at all.  We're trying to find the best.
I like it.
You started off a little bit shaky, you're probably a little nervous, but at
the end, I was like a'ight, you know what?  She's not bad.  She's a'ight.
It was ok.
You brought it home.
You did your thing.  Great.  Very nice.  Very nice.

I didn't expect to hear a pop voice come out of you.
It was really interesting, but it was really refreshing.
I think you did do alright.
You have a very rich tone.
You did fall flat in some areas.
Now, you do have a personality.  You really, really do.
You have a great personality.  You really, really do.
You have a real wonderful voice.
It is hard to sing that song.
But, you did your thing.
You did it really well.
Good job.
I think you've come a long way.
I think you did really well today.
That song is not the easiest one to sing, and I think you did your thing.
I like the twist at the end.
A little pitchy kinda in the middle, but overall good.
You really put your all into it, especially at the end when you put your
passion/gut into it.
Passion is everything.
I think that this is what you call a "seamless, beautiful, perfect performance."
You did an amazing, amazing, brilliant, stupendous job.
Unbelievable.
It's amazing.
Honey, you sang off-key, almost the entire song.  You don't hear that?  \
You don't hear that when you're singing?
You didn't sing remotely near the next American Idol that we'll pick.
Nice voice.  Very nice voice.
I think you'll come to Hollywood and nail it.
No.  I'm sorry.  I don't think you did a great job here.
I love it.  I love you.
Really deep down inside, when you ask yourself, "Am I really a good singer?"  \
Would you really, in your soul, think you are a good singer?
You have a great voice.  Smooth.
Amazing from the first note to the very last.  Brilliant.
Oh boy.  I'm speechles.  Quite honestly, I don't know what to say.
I think you are a beautiful girl.  You came in looking great.
Very pure, very crystal clear, and very mature for your age.  Very very nice.
Good job.  Nice voice.  Very nice.
I've never seen so much committment from a contestant.  You're totally
committed and I love you for that.  You're very committed.
*stunned silence*
Good voice.  Way to go.
Wow.  I think you have the X factor.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Wonerful.
Really unique.  And a nice song.  You nailed it.
You have a unique sound.
You really are beautiful.  You oversang the song.
I really really like your voice.  I do.  I really love the song selection.
I'm seeing a lot of oversinging.  I feel that once again, subtlety is key.
Work on your showmanship because you have a real nice voice.
You are stunning.  The camera loves you.
Amazing!
Unbelievable!  Unbelieveable!
Great song.
I'm telling you, you just blew me away.  Blew me away.
What a beautiful voice, and different.  Unique.  Refreshing.
In tune all the way!
Brilliant.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.
I think you have amazing star quality.
I don't know if it was the right key for you.  You were a little under the \
whole way through.
This is what this competition's about.
You raised the bar.  You surpassed the bar.
You're a star.
You have this confidence about you that is quiet and subtle.  It's not \
intimidating, and you welcome everybody in.
Yeah, I liked it.  Lots.  I really did.
I definately fell that you did a much better job.  I was a little concerned, \
especially with the song.
Good job.
You shine tonight.  You shine.

You're probably capable of singing better than that.
You know what I mean.
It was like something ... not quite right.
I think you could have done better than this, but well done.
I thought that technically it was a good audition.
I was watching you on the monitor and there's no spark.
You look dead, like fish on a slab.
This isn't going to make me very popular, but I'm going to say it.
You have a great personality, great voice.
Brilliant choice of song.
I thought it was good.
I'm not jumping out of my chair, but it was good.
Very, very, very good.
So what.
I mean it, but I don't mean it rudely.
Sometimes you walk away from these shows thinking, "God, that was amazing."
And then some people you go, "So what?"
It was quite a cabaret performance.
It was a bit kinda "small bar Las Vegas."  Not big bar.
You're capable of better than this.
It was a bit old-fashioned.
You're better than that.
unchained melody
I just thought that it was ok.
no sparks
a lot of nerves
bad song choices
I think the reality is, I've heard better people sing outside subway stations.
Look, [saying]
You were horrible.
I agree with Paula.
Good voice.
You're good.  I'm just bored today.
Let me just put this into perspective.  If you were to win, and sing a song, \
you would kill the American record industry.  That's how bad you are.
I don't want to be rude, but you could be the worst singer in New York.
Very, very, very good.  You're one of the few people who've come in here and \
made it look effortless.
You have a very, very good tone to your voice.
Great singer.
That wasn't dreadful, and it wasn't horrible.  It was absolutely ghastly.
You can't sing.
There's only so much punishment a human being can take.
I can't take any more.
I liked your voice.  I just don't like the way you look, if I'm being honest.
Without this competition, you walked into all the record labels in New York, \
I don't think any of them would be jumping out of their offices.
You have one of the worst voices I have ever heard.  Truthfully.  It is \
absolutely terrible.  You can't sing.
Go out of here, call up your vocal coach, and demand a refund.
You have a very good voice.  Very good voice.
One of the few people who have made that song interesting.
I think you have a beautiful voice.
You're one of the worst singers I've ever heard in my life.
*stunned silence*
You have so much more than a lot of people we have put through, which is you \
make a good pop star.
You look great.  You sound good.  Very good.  Very good.
Everything hideous.
Not even for Bulgarian Idol.
I've heard better.
Very good.  Your timing was a bit off, but very good.
You have a nice face and a very good voice.
It sounded to me like you were shouting.
Your mouth is over accentuated.
Interesting.  You looked at the end how I look in a dentist's chair.  You \
looked really miserable at the end of the performance.  In pain.
That was not good.  You really chose the wrong song.
It didn't suit your voice.
It didn't sound very good.
You're singing the wrong kind of song.  You look the part.  You could sing \
the part.
It just looks right, you standing there where it says American Idol.
When you started to sing, the first thing that went through my mind is that
you sound like someone who should be singing on a cruise ship.  Then,
halfway through the song, I imagined the ship singing.
You put me in a good mood now.
This is the time to really really shine, and it was unimpressive.
I was really impressed!
That was a fantastic performance.  Really really fantastic.
It was great.  Really, really great.
One of the most difficult songs to sing, that song.  I thought you did \
brilliantly.
It wasn't good enough.  Sorry.
You had about as much passion as a kitten mewing.  Give it something!  It \
was so wrong for you, that song.
I thought it was a terrible audition.
Wrong song choice, and I just think you are capable of better.
I think you are the package.  One of the best we've seen in the \
whole competition.
It was good.  I'm not jumping out of my chair.  It was, in the words of \
Paula Abdul, "Good job."
Maybe I'm just in a bad mood.  *pout*

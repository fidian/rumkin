<b>September 4, 2003:</b>  All characters look good.  Submit the little

<br><b>August 12, 2003:</b>  Updated the <a

Section('What is going on?  (And why are you being so nice?)');

?>

<p>You are a high-level character.  You'll be roped into a party that will
dive into a fearsome wizard's tower.  The wizard has a few friends and some
surprizes set up.  The goal?  Just to live and get into the treasure room.
If you make it in, you'll likely be able to get out.</p>

<p>This will be a weekend campaign.  I hope that it doesn't extend beyond
that.  It might only last a couple hours though ... that's all up to how
things play out.  What I need from everyone is at least one character
description and what weekends they can <i>not</i> play this campaign.
Plan for a full Saturday and a full Sunday -- I imagine that everyone will
be staying here and a standard breakfast/dinner/lunch fare will be worked 
out.</p>

<?php

if (0) { ?>

<p>The character descriptions that I need from you is the type of character
that you plan on creating.  I need physical looks, mannerisms, what you have
in mind while creating the character, class, age, gender, height, weight,
alignment, and anything else that would be outwardly observable somehow.
<b>Do not roll your character!</b>  There will be specific criteria
presented that you will need to keep in mind while creating your character.
So, if you make your character ahead of time, you will actually be at a 
disadvantage.</p>

<p>I will pick one person at random to get the "hook" and they will pick
their favorite character (likely their only character) to play.
I will present to the character the adventure hook and that poor, unfortunate
soul will be the one responsible for generating the party.  They will hold
auditions, pick up beggars, or wave their magic wand and pluck party members
from the sky.  I will lean a little so that everyone has one of their
characters picked, if possible.  (If everyone only makes fighters, some
people are likely going to have to make new character descriptions.  Sorry.)
This will all be done over the phone and no rolling should be necessary.</p>

<p>After that, people should have a couple weeks (at least) to roll up their
characters and submit them to me.  Then we play!  We'll be using <a 
href="../house_rules.html">Guenever's House Rules</a>,
in case you were wondering.  There will be potentially a few changes, which 
will be listed here.</p>


<?php
} else { ?>

<p>I picked one person at random to get the "hook" and they have started
picking members for the party.  Assembling the party is entirely up to them,
but I lean a little so everyone has a character to play in the upcoming
campaign.  You might need to make a new character -- if everyone only makes
fighters, some people are likely going to need to create totally new
characters.  Sorry.</p>

<?php Section('What do I need to do?'); ?>

<?php

if (0) { ?>

<p>Before we set a date, I need this list of things from you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give me at least one character
  <ul>
  <li>Physical description of character, clothes, intended weapons, age,
      gender, height, weight, etc.
  <li>Personality of character, alignment, classes (and prestige classes),
      mannerisms, alignment
  <li><i>Do not roll your character!</i></li>
  <li>[Optional] Select an image for your player, or submit a new one to me
(ask me how to see my image collection)
  </ul>
<li>Tell me what weekends you can not play in September
</ul>

<p>Once the date is set and I give one person the hook, things are
essentially set and should not change.  A weekend will be scheduled, and
your additional requirements will be posted here.</p>

<?php
} else { ?>

<ul>
<li>I will need a sheet that explains what you get at each level.  If you
get an extra feat at 6th level, I want to know what feat that is.  This is
more a tool for you to make sure you have the proper prerequisites while
building your character.  This is all laid out on my <a
href="worksheet.php">worksheet</a>.
  <ul>
  <li>What feats you took
  <li>Hit points (amount you rolled, amount that you added -- separately)
  <li>Ability score changes
  <li>What class you levelled
  <li>(not skills, spells)
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Ability points are rolled with 4d4, drop the lowest, add 6.  Better than
average, but you are high level and the weak ones were ... eliminated.
<li>The character I told you to make is 17th level. If you are multi-classed
and suffer experience point penalties, you will be of a lower level than the
rest of the party.
<li>You get 340,000 gold.  That can buy any magic weapon at market price.
If you are a magic user, you can make it at the standard discount of 1/2
the cost, but you also lose experience and will be a lower level than the 
rest of the party.
<li>I want to see your character before we play so I can make sure I like
it.  If you have odd stuff (hand of Vecna), then I will need a reason you
have it.  &lt;grin&gt;
<li>Custom magic items must be passed through me and all properties must be
explained and written down.  The cost for the magic item will be provided by
Tyler unless there is a reasonable gp cost already associated with the item,
and that gp cost was generated with 3ed rules.  Any item from a 3ed (3rd
Edition D&amp;D -- a.k.a. d20 system) book should have an appropriate cost.
Anything older will need to be looked at.
</ul>

<?php Section('Alterations to Rules'); ?>

<p>We will be using <a href="house_rules.html">Guenever's House Rules</a>
with the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initiative will be as per 3rd edition rules.</li>
<li><i>Elemental Aura</i> only has a +2 market price (not +3).</li>
</ul>

<?php
} ?>

<?php Section('When will we be doing this?'); ?>

<p>The second weekend in September.  That friday, I will encourage people to
come over and we can chat about the characters and get things ready --
voluntary attendance.  Saturday, we play.  It likely will take all day and
extend into Sunday, so plan only D&amp;D for that entire weekend.</p>

<p>If you can not play that weekend, let me know ASAP.  I will require about
a two week notice in order to reschedule D&amp;D to fit your schedule, if it
is even possible.</p>

<?php Section('Characters Submitted'); ?>

<?php

if (0) { ?>

<p>I used to ask for two characters from everyone.  That seems now like such
an amazingly unobtainable goal.  I'm seriously hoping everyone has one
submitted before I give out the hook.  You need one (yours or provided by
someone else) to play before I start the ball rolling.  You need to submit
it in writing (email, postal, etc.) or have me write everything down in a
phone conversation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Aaron:  1 (Can submit more for people who don't have time)</li>
<li>Brian:  1</li>
<li>Chris:  1 (Got the adventure hook)</li>
<li>John:  0</li>
<li>Nikki:  1</li>
<li>Phil:  1</li>
<li>Sarah:  1</li>
<li>Tyler:  Lots (Needs to provide bad guys that everyone else kills)
<li>&Uuml;lli:  0</li>
</ul>

<?php
} else { ?>

<p>This will show who has submitted a character to me before the due date.
This is the completed character sheets, descriptions of magic items, a
completed worksheet, etc.  If you have a "0" next to your name on September
1st, you aren't playing.  If a lot of people aren't playing, the ones who
make it in are going to be advanced a level or two in order to balance the
campaign.</p>

<ul>
<li>Aaron:  1</li>
<li>Brian:  1</li>
<li>Chris:  1</li>
<li>Nikki:  1</li>
<li>Phil:  1</li>
<li>Ryan:  0  (Might be playing)</li>
<li>Sarah:  1</li>

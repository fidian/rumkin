<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT FACE="Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:14.0px'>You should add Vyse gelatin to you list of suppliers of gelatin<BR>
They can buy the REAL thing from us. We hold the trade mark on &#8220;BALLISTIC GELATIN&#8221;<BR>
We can ship it to the customers door at a cost that is lower than any place. <BR>
<BR>
It is the same product that the military, FBI, and most ammo &nbsp;manufacturers are using.<BR>
<BR>
I&#8217;m not sure off hand but, &nbsp;you could be in legal jeopardy by use our trade mark without permission. &nbsp;<BR>
It is possible that if you replace the Knox name with Vyse, the matter would be dismissed.<BR>

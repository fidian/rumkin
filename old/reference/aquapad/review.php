<p>Sorry, but right now this is just a brief review of my experiences with
the AquaPad.</p>

<ul>
<li>Handwriting recognition blows goats.</li>
<li>Keyboard hunt and peck with stylus is s ... l ... o ... w.</li>
<li>Mozilla loads slowly, as it does on most other computers.</li>
<li>Mozilla is so old and unstable that I need to replace it before I even
really start using the AquaPad.</li>
<li>The most replaceable component, the internal Compact Flash card, is the
least accessable item in the whole case.</li>
</ul>

<p>This would work well for simple web sites, where getting information is
the only thing you need.  If you must type in data, you're better off at a
bigger computer.</p>

<p>Even though the AquaPad has all of these limitations, I plan on
recompiling the Midori Linux installation so that I can get things upgraded
and throw in extra fun software.</p>

# Elf names
# PSR rules initially based on ones at
#  http://www.kanga.nu/archives/MUD-Dev-L/1997Q2/msg01379.php
# From Martin Keegan <martin@cam.sri.com>
#
# Comments start with a # at the beginning of a line
# Blank lines are ignored
# Initial key should have a * before it and can be followed by spaces
# Keys should be in [brackets]
# Key names with a ^ in front are capitalized (see the only line in ELFNAME)
# Case matters
# First key is the main rule
# Spaces at beginning and end are removed
# Rules can have a number followed by a colon prepended to have a chance
# associated with it.

<p>If you use your flash drive a lot, like I do, you will want to have a menu so that you can run programs easier. I searched for one that was free and freely distributable. One that was small, quick, and simple. I found &quot;Floater 1.0&quot; by Daniel Werner. To operate it, you just make a directory called <code>Items/</code> in the same directory as <code>Floater.exe</code> and fill it up with shortcuts to the programs you want in the menu. When you run Floater, it will create a bar in the lower left corner, above the Start button, and it will have icons in it, one for each program you put in the <code>Items/</code> folder.</p><p>This works wonderfully on a hard drive, or when you know the full path of the programs, but a flash drive won&#39;t always be the same drive name on each computer you plug it into. On one it is I:, on another it is E:. Because you can not make a shortcut to a program without specifying the drive letter, I decided to alter Floater to read paths from a text file.</p><p>Floater-txt is based on the original Floater, but I fixed a couple cosmetic errors, made the menu shrink when you run a program, and made it read from <code>Floater.txt</code> instead of using an <code>Items/</code> directory. You specify one menu item per line. There are two different ways to specify a program. The first has a description, a pipe symbol (the | character), and then the filename. The second uses just the filename.</p><pre><code>Notepad|c:\windows\notepad.exe
c:\windows\calc.exe
</code></pre><p>The advantage here is that you can use relative paths. <code>..\Directory\Path.exe</code> will work now, so you can use Floater as the menu system for your flash drive.</p><h2 id=screen-shots>Screen Shots</h2><p>Here is how it looks on Windows XP. The configuration file (<code>Floater.txt</code>) is open so you can refer to how I made the four programs appear.</p><div class=Mx(a)><img src=floater-open.png></div><p>And this is how it looks when you toggle it to the &quot;closed&quot; state.</p><div class=Mx(a)><img src=floater-closed.png></div><h2 id=downloads>Downloads</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=floater1.0.zip>Floater 1.0</a></strong> - The original, complete with source code for Visual C 6.0.</li><li><strong><a href=floater-txt1.0.zip>Floater-txt 1.0</a></strong> - My version that reads its information from a text file, also complete with Visual C 6.0 source.</li></ul>

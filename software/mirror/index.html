<p>Yes, I know that there are other tools out there, and I am especially aware of <code>rsync</code>, but there was a need for a PERL-based mirror tool. I wrote one that only copies the file if the size is different or the source timestamp is newer than the destination timestamp. It works extra-well if it is copying to/from the same filesystem or when the filesystems have the same time.</p><p>Download it as <a href=mirror.pl.txt>mirror.pl.txt</a> and you&#39;ll likely want to save it as <code>mirror.pl</code>. It requires the PERL module <code>File::Copy</code>. Open up <code>mirror.pl</code> and make sure that the <code>$Source</code> and <code>$Dest</code> parameters are set up.</p>

<p>I once wrote a live chat system that was featured at the bottom of the pages on my site. It included bad word filtering and rate limiting. The PHP source is available in <a href=feedback.zip>feedback.zip</a>.</p><p>Be warned - this includes the most recent copy of my scripts, which lists the words I am filtering (<em>avert thine eyes!</em>) and the rules that I previously employed. It was designed to go with any theme system on your site, but the theming is not included. Thus, if you see references to <code>$theme</code>, you now know why that&#39;s there.</p><p>There is a simple <code>readme.txt</code> file that discusses how to set it up. Really, the documentation for this thing is quite sparse, but this tool is extremely simple as well and it doesn&#39;t need much.</p><ul><li>Server Requirements: PHP 4.x (and probably newer versions), MySQL</li><li>Browser Requirements: None. Works with Mozilla, Netscape, IE, Opera, Links, Lynx, and even the web browsers on cell phones.</li></ul>

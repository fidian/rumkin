In fact, most people have had more than one device. What do you do with the old one?</p><p>I would recommend keeping it around, along with a solar charger and battery pack. Pre-install some software on it just in case things go sideways. Be ready.</p><p>Where do you start? Well, you want to make your device as useful as possible and not rely upon wireless connections to get data in a pinch.</p><ul><li>Navigation - offline maps, GPS navigation, compass</li><li>Utility - flashlight, magnifier</li><li>Information - reference e-books, e-book reader</li></ul><p>The following is a list of tools that I recommend to help cover these areas. Several are for Android because those devices are cheaper, plus I would recommend using <a href=https://f-droid.org/en/ >F-Droid</a>, especially for older devices where using <a href=https://play.google.com/store/apps>Google Play Store</a> has issues installing software. If you have suggestions, email me and let me know what I missed or how your suggestion is better.</p><h2 id=organic-maps-offline-hike-bike-trails-and-navigation>Organic Maps: Offline Hike, Bike, Trails and Navigation</h2><p>Uses the crowd-sourced and free OpenStreetMap data and allows you to download areas in advance, so you are never stuck without a handy map. It supports <em>all</em> of its features without an internet connection; show roads, find points of interest, look for businesses, and turn by turn navigation can all be done offline.</p><p>After downloading, go to the menu and download maps. The maps themselves aren&#39;t very large - one of my spare devices only has 2 Gb of free space, which lets me download my state plus the five nearby, which consumes less than 1 Gb total.</p><ul><li><a href=https://organicmaps.app/ >Website</a></li><li><a href=https://apps.apple.com/app/organic-maps/id1567437057>Apple&#39;s AppStore</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.organicmaps&hl=en">Google Play</a></li><li><a href=https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.organicmaps/ >F-Droid</a></li><li><a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C104325611?local=en">Huawei AppGallery</a></li></ul><h2 id=first-aid-by-the-american-red-cross>First Aid, by the American Red Cross</h2><p>More than just a handy reference for common problems, this app also provides checklists to help you prepare and quizzes to make sure you understand the material.

Optimized for size and simplicity. This is a PWA, so to install it you will need to visit the page and use your menu to install the application. It operates entirely offline and will update only when you run it (such is the life of PWA apps). Free and open source. Works for desktops, Android, and iOS/Apple.</p><p>Included tools: flashlight, front light (white screen), magnifier, compass, GPS location, barcode and QR code reader, sun and moon information. Coordinates are shown in several formats; nearest large city&#39;s name, distance, and direction; saving, loading, and sharing waypoints via QR code.</p><ul><li><a href=https://be-prepared.github.io/ >Live App</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/be-Prepared/Be-Prepared.github.io/ >Source Code</a></li></ul><h2 id=additional-tips>Additional Tips</h2><p>In order to make your device easier to use, I would recommend these steps:</p><ul><li>Format the device and remove any SIM card.</li><li>Skip adding a user or create a new user that you use for your emergency phones.</li><li>Do not set up a lock. Make it so you just swipe or press the power button and the phone is working.</li><li>Upgrade any apps and install system updates. For older phones, this can be a problem because the current app stores may no longer support your phone&#39;s version. Try doing updates, then wait an hour and see what worked and what else needs to be done. Reboot the phone and repeat until it works. (At least that worked for me.)</li><li>Install only apps you believe you will need in case of an emergency.</li><li>Turn on airplane mode. Turn off Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, and other wireless services.</li><li>Charge the battery fully, then power off the phone.</li><li>If possible, remove the battery from the phone when storing it.</li><li>Store the device safely where the battery doesn&#39;t get hot and doesn&#39;t get below freezing.</li><li>For the extra paranoid, wrap with foil or use other EMP-shielding countermeasures.</li><li>Set a schedule to recharge and check on the phone every few months or every year. Remember to update apps, review any ebooks on the phone, and download updated maps to use them offline.</li></ul><p>If you are looking for tips to extend your battery life, do the following:</p><ul><li>Turn on airplane mode unless you intend to use cellular services. This one is the biggest power drain for devices when the displays are off.</li><li>Turn off Bluetooth and WiFi when not in use. Even having the radio enabled will drain energy.</li><li>Dimming your screen really helps extend your battery..</li><li>Uninstall any other application that you do not use. They may periodically reach out to servers or process data and you want to save energy.</li></ul></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="Bgc(barBackground) Bgc(tr)--p Bdtw(1px) Bdc(barBorder) C(barText) C(black)--p P(10px) D(f) Fxd(c)--p Jc(spb)"><div class=Fz(0.8em)>&copy; Copyright 2024 Tyler Akins &lt;<a class="Td(n)--p C(barText) C(black)--p" href=mailto:fidian@rumkin.com>fidian@rumkin.com</a>&gt;, last build 2024-12-22T18:01:03.700Z</div><div><a class="D(n)--p Fz(0.8em) C(barText)" href=../../license/ >License</a> | <a class="D(n)--p Fz(0.8em) C(barText)" href=../../reference/site/legal/ >Legal</a> <a class="D(n) D(b)--p Td(n) Fz(0.8em)" href=../../license/ >Site content licensed under a MIT license with a non-advertising clause</a></div></footer></div></body></html>

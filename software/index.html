<p>I wrote a bunch of little tools and pieces of software. Other things have been found on the internet but have not stuck around, so I mirrored a couple of those useful things onto my site for safe storage.</p><ul><li><p><a href=burp/ >BURP</a> - Encrypt a single file with Blowfish encryption. Command-line based, public domain, ported to many platforms. I have also written a Windows GUI.</p></li><li><p><a href=dbf-tools/ >DBF Tools</a> - Some utilities I whipped up to boil down a &#x60;.dbf&#x60; file by aggregating the records and another to concatenate multiple database files together.</p></li><li><p><a href=dnd-helper/ >D&amp;D Helper</a> - Palm OS program that is designed to help out DMs and characters. It tries to speed up the game by rolling large amounts of dice and performing time-consuming calculations. It can also look up information and generate various things.</p></li><li><p><a href=dos-boot-disk/ >DOS Boot Disk</a> - Copies of my old 1.44 MiB floppy disk image that I used to save so many different systems.</p></li><li><p><a href=email/ >Email Validation Done Right</a> - Javascript and PHP code that will verify that an email address at least appears valid and should pass RFC checks.</p></li><li><p><a href=feedback/ >Feedback Box</a> - A live feedback system. This can power a chat box that you can include on pages, giving visitors the ability to chat with each other and you can also monitor it for early problem detection with your site.</p></li><li><p><a href=floater/ >Floater</a> - A floating menu for Windows, complete with source. Also has an altered version that works well on a flash drive.</p></li><li><p><a href=foxpro/ >FoxPro</a> - Useful things that I have written. Maybe it could help you out too?</p></li><li><p><a href=gpx-tools/ >GPX Tools for Geocaching</a> - Command-line utilities that will alter the GPX files retrieved from a geocaching pocket query.</p></li><li><p><a href=marco/ >Marco</a> - Surveyor software for the Palm Pilot and other Palm OS devices. Designed to be a tool for quick calculations and small amounts of number crunching. Not a complete solution for surveying, but a fast and quick reference and calculator.</p></li><li><p><a href=mirror/ >Perl Mirror Script</a> - Perl program to mirror a set of directories with a list of exclusions.</p></li><li><p><a href=padxor/ >One Time Pad XOR</a> - Encrypt a file with a one-time pad, which is the only unbreakable cipher in existence.</p></li><li><p><a href=palm/ >Palm OS Software</a> - A local copy of several Palm programs, all of which are free to use.</p></li><li><p><a href=puzzle/ >Java Puzzle Applet</a> - Want a free puzzle that you can stick in your web pages? Try this one out! It is small, fast, very compatible, and takes almost all work out of putting up a puzzle site of your own.</p></li><li><p><a href=salangmenu/ >SalangMenu</a> - Tiny little menu system that is completely configurable through parameter tags.</p></li><li><p><a href=sdif/ >SDIF Data Extraction (Novell)</a> - Retrieves SDIF-wrapped files from a Novell backup.</p></li><li><p><a href=tapes/ >Tape Tools</a> - C programs designed to get data off of tapes from a Linux system. Especially geared for 3480/3490 tapes.</p></li><li><p><a href=tools/ >Miscellaneous Tools</a> - Little things that I don&#x27;t know where else to put.</p></li><li><p><a href=untgz-dll/ >UNTGZ DLL</a> - Dynamic library for Windows that will decompress &#x60;.tar.gz&#x60; and &#x60;.tgz&#x60; files.</p></li><li><p><a href=untgz/ >UNTGZ</a> - Extract .tar and .tgz (.tar.gz) files. Automatic long filename conversion. DOS, DOS 386+, Win32 for Windows 95/98/2000/NT/ME/XP, native OS/2. Freeware, open source under GPL v2, with source code. Also a VERY tiny version.</p></li><li><p><a href=usbstart/ >USBStart</a> - A nice program that will help you automatically run another program on your USB drive. When that program exits, the drive will be automatically dismounted. Great for use with Floater.</p></li></ul>

<p>While searching for a good file encryption utility, I decided that I wanted one that was open source, cross-platform, and easy to use. I wanted versions that would run on Linux, DOS, and Windows (Win32). <a href=http://www.geodyssey.com/cryptography/cryptography.html>BURP</a> fits the bill perfectly. It stands for Blowfish Updated Re-entrant Project.</p><p>The only problem was that there was no GUI for Windows. Not a problem! I quickly designed one in <a href=http://www.autoitscript.com/ >AutoIt</a>, which is a wonderful scripting language. Now there is BURP-GUI. I also packed the BURP executables listed below with UPX to make them smaller, which is perfect for keeping them on my rescue CD and on flash drives.</p><h2 id=requirements>Requirements</h2><p>BURP-GUI needs a 32-bit Windows OS. This includes Windows 94, 98, NT, 2000, ME, XP, or later.</p><p>Your temporary directory for Windows needs to be properly set. BURP-GUI extracts <code>BURP32.EXE</code> to the temporary directory and runs it from there so you can include BURP-GUI on a CD or other read-only medium. Output is captured to a temporary text file, read in by the GUI, and both files are removed from the filesystem.</p><h2 id=warnings>Warnings</h2><p>Your password could be cached in swap, held in the registry, and other assorted things. This is just a front-end to a DOS command-line utility, so who really knows for certain where your password ends up. However, it shouldn&#39;t swap unless you are low on available memory and it shouldn&#39;t stick it into the registry and cache your password (at least in my tests).</p><p>If you don&#39;t use the same password for decrypting as you did for encrypting, you will end up with a file full of garbage. There are no special headers that BURP uses to make sure that everything went well. BURP will say that the operation was successful and you&#39;ll end up with random-looking data.</p><h2 id=compiling>Compiling</h2><p>To compile BURP-GUI, you will need a file named <code>BURP32.EXE</code>. You can use the original <code>BURP32.EXE</code> or my UPX-compressed <code>BURP32.EXE</code>. Just stick it in the same directory as <code>BURP-GUI.AU3</code> before you run/compile the code.</p><h2 id=license>License</h2><p>I place BURP-GUI in the public domain, just like how BURP was licensed. The software comes with no warranty, so only execute it if you plan to take responsibility for all risks. I suggest that if you are really cautious that you should read the source code and compile it yourself so that you can feel safer.</p><h2 id=download--links>Download / Links</h2><p>You should also check out the <a href=http://www.geodyssey.com/cryptography/cryptography.html>official site</a> for news and updates to BURP. You should get the freeware scripting language, <a href=http://www.autoitscript.com/ >AutoIt</a>, if you want to recompile the GUI.</p><ul><li><a href=burp-gui.zip>burp-gui.zip</a> - Windows GUI and the AutoIt 3 source code</li><li><a href=burp-dos.zip>burp-dos.zip</a> - DOS executable, UPX compressed</li><li><a href=burp-win32.zip>burp-win32.zip</a> - DOS/Win32 console executable, UPX compressed</li><li><a href=burp-linux.zip>burp-linux.zip</a> - Linux executable, UPX compressed</li><li><a href=burp120.zip>burp120.zip</a> - Mirror of the original BURP 1.20 archive</li></ul><h2 id=changes>Changes</h2><ul><li><p>2004-06-30 (1.1) - Removed 16-bit version (Windows 3.1) because AutoIt doesn&#39;t run on 16-bit systems.

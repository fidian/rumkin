<p>I would like to properly thank the following people for the things that
they did to help out this project:</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>Playtesters</b></dt>
<dd>Sarah Akins (my wife) -- The first DM to use this program.  She also has
a lot of sway on how the program looks and what goes into it.</dd>

<dt><b>Contributions</b></dt>
<dd>D&amp;D Adventures
-- Gave me permission to use the critical hit and fumble tables from <a
href="http://www.dndadventure.com">dndadventure.com</a> as long as I don't
charge for anything.</dd>
<dd>Scott Crawford &lt;<?PHP HideEmail('scott', 'crawford.net') ?>&gt;
-- Created <a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/s/c/scraw68/">D&amp;D Tools</a>, 
which I thought was a good start but didn't go far enough.  He also gave me
the source to his program so that I could improve mine.  Great guy!</dd>

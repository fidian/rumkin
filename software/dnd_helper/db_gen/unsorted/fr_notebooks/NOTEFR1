  BOOK OF CHONDATH
  Upon his discovery of the Realms, Bane held a great feast of blood, in
  celebration
  of the bloodtelling to come.  His talons were red and dripping with venom as
  he
  descended for the first time into the new lands, and he placed his iron foot,
  which
  burned with pillaging fire, on Burgateth, highest mountain of Chondath.  And
  he
  crushed it, and burned it, so that afterwards it was but a lifeless hill of
  black glass,
  burning crystal.

  Then Bane, seeing the lifelessness and ruin in the middle of such beauty
  smiled,
  and spoke with a voice like that of carrion:  "Let this place resonate with
  new songs;
  the cries of the warrior, the melody of clashing swords, the harmony of iron
  shod
  boots marching in unison over the stones, the crescendo of the death wail,
  and the
  chorus of the widow's lament.  Let this place be a tapestry upon which I shall
   paint
  new scenes, and blood and ash shall be my pigments.  These are the things that
   I
  cherish, and they shall dominate this place, as they do wherever the hearts of
   men
  are weak and quick to desire.  The four winds shall spread these things to
  every
  corner of this land, and no creature shall evade them.  This place is a
  special
  symbol of my domination, and I shall name it Thurgabanteth, the Hill of Black
  Ruin.
  It is my footstool, a portent of my final victory."

  Satisfied, Bane retreated to his domain, and watched with hateful eyes as his
  terrible
  seed began its work.


  BATTLE OF URML

  In the thunder they came
  the hordes of war
  and rent the hells
  with the cries of bloodlust
  On steel-shod beasts
  that beat a tattoo
  of death and destruction
  on innocent breasts

  The horns were blown
  the clarion calling
  and ,men left their wives
  and children crying
  to mount their steeds
  to meet the invaders
  whose numbers seemed endless
  from the foothills streaming

  then white robed clerics
  fell down on skinned knees
  and prayed to Tyr
  the God of justice
  to right the scales
  to stop the swinging
  of goblin axes
  slippery with gore

  'Twas then a hush
  fell o'er the village
  and all eyes together
  goblin and mankind
  in the space of a heartbeat
  turned towards the mountains
  a tall stony finger
  the peak named Tyr's Watch

  For there standing proud
  at the top of the summit
  a man in white armor
  with white horse beneath him
  right hand extended
  raised towards the heavens
  sunlight reflecting
  from a fist of bright steel

  Then swiftly he galloped
  into the battle
  and pointing his hand
  the hand of bright metal
  he called down the lightning
  to strike the invaders
  and goblin screams mixed
  with cheers of the townfold

  And fear filled the faces
  where once there was bloodlust
  as goblin smote goblin
  and steed attacked steed
  the air filled with smoke
  and green droplets flying
  as the battle was turned
  and the raiders repelled

  The battle was ended
  and slowly the victors
  emerged from their quarters
  to search for survivors
  or bury the dead

  but no sign coud be found
  of the man in white armor
  'Cept a fist of bright steel
  in a puddle of blood


  Plates of the Katti'n Tundra


   This book is three handwidths wide by five handwidths high.
  The book consists of seven whale bone plates in a specially tanned seal
  skin leather pouch (+2 on all saves). The first and last bone plates,
  slightly larger than the others (about 1" on each side), serve primarily to
  protect the other plates. The other five plates each have one spell engraved
  into the front, one spell per plate.  The pouch is tied closed with four
  leather tie strings, each of which has a small copper bead on the end.
  A general inspection of the whole will reveal that the pouch could hold two,
  maybe three more plates.

  HISTORY:
    This book was scribed by the anagakok wizards of the tribes of
  the Katti'n Tundra over fifty years ago.  This was one of the first peace
  overtures to unite the competing tribes.  The wizards were instrumental
  in the unification partly because of their influence in the tribe, and
  also because of the omens they began receiving.  Many wizards from several
  tribes independently prophesied that disaster would strike the Tundra;
  as protection, the wizards used all of their influence to unite the tribes.
  The wizards created the Plates, which was a collection of spells well
  suited for the arctic and sub-arctic environments.  Any wizard in good
  standing with his tribe from any tribe could have access to the spells
  on the plates.
          Thirty years later, disaster did strike.  The orc army of King Therz
  of the Benteye Clan (a clan which long ago originated in the Kara Tur)
  invaded the Tundra.  King Therz was goaded forward by the power hungry Clan
  witch doctor Gorl (priest/mage to Grummish).  The now united tribes fought
  well for two Hunting Seasons (neither side would fight during the Storm
  Season).  During the second Storm Season, the traitor wizard Dambwe went
  to King Therz with the Plates, one of the symbols of tribal unity, in hopes
  to further his own cause.  Dambwe was beheaded by King Therz, who gave the
  plates to his cousin Gorl.  Gorl and his servants, who were given a few
  carefully selected spells, were able to use the magic of the Plates to give
  the orcish armies an advantage.  In the fourth Hunting Season, the orcish
  army defeated the last of the tribes' defenses.  King Therz personally took
  part in this battle, but only at the urging of Gorl.  During the battle, King
  Therz became engaged with several tribesmen.  During this fight, which
  was on the edge of the battle, Gorl fell his cousin Therz with a Magic
  Missile spell.  He thought none of the orcs would see, but he was wrong.
  That night, he was beheaded by Therz's oldest son Tark.  King Tark, who
  had always been superstitious, limited the influence of the witch doctors.
  He took back the plates, not understanding that the witch doctors could
  still use the spells with copies of the material and not just the original
  itself, and kept them as a personal symbol of power.  About five years
  later when King Tark died of natural causes, the person who assisted his
  death of natural causes (many think with frost spider venom) took the Plates,
  among other, although few, trophies.
          The book has been missing ever since.  Reports of the book surface
  periodically.  The last major report was by the Mage Verestarin Redbeard of
  the College of the High Arts in the northern realm of Pemal.  During his last
  adventure, he had reportedly met an anonyous traveler, claiming to be a spice
  merchant, who was interested in local lore.  The Plates were mentioned, and
  the conversation turned to them.  That night, the mysterious traveler visited
  Verestarin's inn room with the Plates.  For a substantial bribe, the traveler
  allowed Verestarin to copy the contents of the Plates.  Copies of
  Verestarin's notes were placed in the College's library, after he was
  sufficiently reimbursed, of course, describing the work itself as well as
  the contents Verestarin saw.  The five spells listed are the most accurate
  catalog of the contents of the Plates.  It is unknown if other plates to the
  set were lost over time, or even withheld from Verestarin by the traveler.
  It is also possible that plates could have been added over time (Verestarin
  could not do an age dating at the time), and the entire set Verestarin was
  exposed to could have been a forgery, although all the spells do work fine.


  M-U Spells

  Fire Aura; (Abjuration)
  Level: 4                        Components: V,S,M
  Range: 0                        Casting Time: 4 segments
  Duration: 2 rounds/level        Saving Throw: Special
  Area of Effect: Caster
  Description: By means of this spell, the caster surrounds his body with an
  aura of magical green fire.  The Fire Aura extends 1 foot from the caster's
  body and provides illumination in a 10-foot radius.  The Fire Aura provides
  complete immunity to all forms of fire, both natural and magical; the flames
  can be extinguished only by a Dispel Magic or a similar spell.  Those
  touching the Fire Aura summer 2-8 (2d4) hit points of damage; additionally,
  if the touched victim fails to make his saving throw, his body is set afire
  with green flames.
          The flames persist for 2-8 (2d4) rounds and can be extinguished only
  by Dispel Magic or a similar spell.  Each round the victim is engulfed in
  these flames, he suffers an additional 1-6 hit points of damage; the victim's
  attack rolls are made with a -2 penalty during this time.
          The material components for this spell are a scrap of singed paper
  and a piece of flint.


  Heal Frost Bite; (Necromancy)
  Level: 3                        Components: V,S,M
  Range: Touch                    Casting Time: 1 round
  Duration: Permanent             Save: None
  Area of Effect: Caster or creature touched

  Description:  This minor healing spell heals frostbite and minor amounts of
  damage caused by cold, as well as any minor infection caused by frostbite or
  cold.  The damage healed is 1-4 hit points plus 1 point per 2 levels of the
  caster.  Note that the damage must be caused by cold or freezing, for weapons
  such as a Frost Brand, only the extra damage caused by the cold is healed.
  The material component is a clear or white gem worth at least 10 gp.


  Chip; (Alteration)
  Level: 1                        Components: V,S,M
  Range: 30'                      Casting Time: 1 segment
  Duration: Permanent             Save: None (1/2)
  Area of Effect: One cubic yard of ice per level (see below)

Due to its size, this text item will be continued in the next text item.

------------------------------ Start of body part 3

  Description:  This spell causes a volume of ice to crack and chip away.
  This spell starts at the point closest to the caster, and chips one cubic
  yard every 5 segments.  Note that the pieces remaining can be rather sharp.
  The wizard can also use this spell to loosen densely packed snow into powdery
  snow.  The spell will affect one five foot cube of snow per level, each cube
  taking 4 segments to loosen.  If used against an ice based creature (para-
  elemental), it will do 2-4 (1d3+1) points of damage per level of the caster,
  save for half (duration instantaneous).  Note that a non solid snow based
  creature would take only 1 point of damage per level, save for half.  Cold
  related creatures (white puddings, white dragons, etc.) take no damage from
  this spell.  The material component is a hand sized ice pick, which must have
  a metal head, which is unharmed by the casting of this spell.

          Note that the Katti'n tribes had access to native copper, as well as
  very basic metal working skills.  (They had copper swords, axes, and arrow
  heads, so hand sized ice picks were available.)  This spell is useful for
  creating a storage niche or even an impromptu shelter in a large ice mass,
  but it does not guarantee structural integrity.  Still, a 10'x 10'x10'
  opening in a mile long glacier will generally be safe.


  Passice; (Alteration)
  Level: 4                        Components: V,S
  Range: 20'                      Casting Time: 6 segments
  Duration: 4 turns + 1 turn/lv.  Save: none
  Area of Effect: see below
  Description:  This spell has the same effect as a Passwall spell, except it
  affects ice.  The opening created is five feet wide, eight feet tall, and
  ten feet deep.  This spell affects ice elementals in the same manner as a
  Passwall affects earth elementals.


  Fireball
  This is essentially the same Fireball in the PH, with a slight change in the
  material component.  Since bats are almost unknown in the arctic, this spell
  was developed using whale oil.  Note that like the paper in Fire Aura, the
  whale oil is a replacement worked into the spell, not an optional
  substitution.  A mage learning Fireball from the Plates would need a supply
  of whale oil, although perhaps another organically produced oil could
  substitute.  In the tropics, dolphin oil should work ~fairly~ well, say
  -10 to 20% on range and/or -1d6 damage.  At that point, the mage simply needs
  to convince the local sailors (preferably Greek) to go kill a few dolphins
  and bring back their carcases. :)
  Spell research is also an option.


  The Singing Rocks

  The Singing Rocks are a tiny group of islands in the Sea of Swords.
  It is due west of a point almost exactly between Memnon and Myratma,
  and for that reason, it is considered the boundary point between
  Calimshan and Tethyr waters.  It is also an important
  navigation point for sea captains afraid of drifting too far west
  in their travels.
       The Singing Rocks is worthy of mention, however, not for its
  navigational importance but for the odd phenomenon that
  gives the islands their name.  Sailors passing close by the islands
  report beautiful singing, as if by hundreds of women.  The music
  has an elusive, haunting quality, but does not seem to have the
  charming effects of the song of the harpy or siren.

  Rumors as to what this is range from, the music caused by a
  powerful old magical horn that was lost in the islands centuries ago,
  or the souls of many women slaves that died when their ship sunk
  near the islands, and some say that it is a powerful enchantment
  cast by a group of female devout clerics who sing in unison,
  after they were shipwrecked on the islands to try to attract other
  ships to save them.

  Recent investigation supports another theory:

       "The Singing Rocks are islands that have nothing to do with the
  magical singing going on around them.  If one goes off at night and
  enters the water at about 150 feet from shore, the mystery becomes
  clear.  A magical line is seen glowing underneath the waters.

  This line forms three 6 pointed stars which meet in the center  with
  an alter.  The stars are the symbol of Liira (Our Lady of Joy).  The
  estimate age of the magic stars and the alter is over 900 years.

  It would seem that this alter is where sea elves who follow Liira
  would come at night to worship their goddess

  The singing is most likely the remnants of some ancient ceremony
  of happiness or joy that was performed by the sea elves at the alter."

  PSIONICS ENCLAVE

  Incidentally, my current campaign is running in the Forgotten Realms
  (else I wouldn't be posting).  In said campaign, the psionicists were
  just discovering that psionic ability could in fact be fostered just
  about the time that the gods were cast down.  Until that time,
  psionics had been a spurious and rare ability, known (still) as the
  Talent (just as magic is known as the Art) -- some possessed it,
  others did not, no one knew why.  Dedicated scholars kept exploring
  the nature of psionics and eventually stumbled upon an important
  discovery -- many "normal" folk might possess the Talent in latent or
  passive forms rather than active ones.  This, of course, opened up
  whole new vistas, and a loose, semi-secret organization of psionicists
  was formed across Faerun -- the Enclave.

  Information about the nature of the Talent was exchanged between
  psionicists for a few decades prior to the Time of Troubles, but
  eventually the members of the Enclave (after the persecution of
  several of their members) reached a crisis.  Though no word of the
  Enclave had been widespread, it was made abundantly clear that
  psionicists were feared and reviled by much of the population.  They
  were, in the eyes of the common folk, no less than mental rapists,
  able to strip away the will and memories of their victims with the
  evil eye.  Those who understood anything at all about psionics got it
  largely confused with the Art, and viewed it as a dangerous and
  corrupt offshoot at that.

  And so it came to pass that the Enclave enforced the Silent Oath --
  members must practice their abilities in absolute secrecy, lest the
  general population bring doom upon them all.  Shortly after the Silent
  Oath was rendered, all of Faerun was struck by a far worse disaster
  than the perceived psionic threat -- the Time of Troubles.  Seizing
  the presented opportunity, the Enclave spent much of the Godswar
  policing their own.  They took active measures to eradicate knowledge
  of the Talent from the population and destroy rogue psionicists who
  refused to take the Silent Oath -- a task that became known as the
  Cleansing.  They were quite successful in their task, and they
  retreated into obscurity after it was finished.  Following the
  Cleansing, nearly all of Faerun's intellectual elite believed that the
  Talent had been lost -- another casualty of the Time of Troubles.


  The Silent Oath persisted for the years following the Godswar, during
  which time small advances in psionic study were made in secret.  Much
  as mages had done for centuries, the members of the Enclave began
  gathering apprentices with the latent Talent and turning them into
  budding psionicists.  Bound to the Silent Oath like their brethren,
  these new, younger members of the Enclave became an existential proof
  for the ability to foster the Talent.

  Unfortunately, there were only perhaps 150 or so active members of the
  Enclave (including apprentices) scattered throughout Faerun, and the
  disadvantages of a loose, far-flung organization began to manifest
  themselves.  Following the Time of Troubles there were no more
  persecutions (since most, if not all, of the population believed that
  there was nothing left to persecute), and the psionicists began to
  grow lax.  Absorbed in the details of their apprentices and the
  mundane aspects of their lives, the members of the Enclave began to
  loose the close-knit unity which had prompted the Cleansing and saved
  them all.  The immediate threat had passed, and other aspects of
  Realms politics began to grow in importance.  Communication between
  the most distant members became more and more infrequent, and the
  members of the Enclave grew content and provincial.

  Finally, a noteworthy telepath (whose name escapes me at the moment
  ;-) who had settled in the peaceful town of Dhedluk several years back
  began to grow concerned about the Enclave's apparent erosion.  He had
  attempted to psionically contact no fewer than three of his psionic
  acquaintances (founding members of the Enclave, like himself) and
  failed.  After speaking with other members that he *could* contact, he
  discovered a disturbing trend -- many of the psionicists were
  unaccounted for.  No one had heard from them in several rides, and no
  one had seen them in months.  It seemed, to all appearances, that the
  psionicists were vanishing.

  MIELIKKI

  The goddess known as Mielikki, Lady of the Forest, is the patron of forests,
  rangers, and
  dryads. The Lady wanders the forests of all Toril, although the followers of
  her faith are
  concentrated in northern Faerun. There is some evidence that Mielikki was an
  elven
  demigoddess before the rise of humans, and she is often depicted with mixed
  elven and
  human features.  Certainly she is worshipped by humans, elves, halfelves, and
  dryads alike.
  Mielikki is assisted by two divine beings of lesser power. On rare occasions
  when Mielikki
  rides into battle, Lurue, the Unicorn serves as her mount. Lurue is a beast
  cult deity, the
  queen of talking beasts and intelligent creatures. Lurue is also known as
  'Silverymoon', and
  is often worshipped in the city of the same name. Gwaeron Windstrom is a
  demigod who also
  serves Mielikki, and is a master of tracking and interpreting woodland signs.
  He is tall and
  physically impressive, with a white beard that constantly whips about in the
  wind, and long
  white hair. He can track infallibly through any conditions, in or on any
  terrain.  Mielikki
  herself often serves the Silvanus the OakFather, god of nature and patron of
  druids. In fact
  some legends relate that she is the offspring of a dalliance between Silvanus
  and the elvish
  goddess of romantic love and beauty called Hannali Celanil. In any case,
  although Mielikki
  nl~mbers no druids among her faithful, her followers certainly count them as
  strong allies, and
  often work alongside the followers of Silvanus.  The followers of Mielikki do
  not organize
  themselves into official temples, rather they assemble in peaceful forest
  glades in collective
  worship to the goddess. The faithful of Mielikki organize themselves into
  three branches of
  devotion, known as the Triad.  The first branch of the Triad are the heart of
  the faith, and
  serve as voices of the souls of the trees themselves. Collectively these
  followers are referred
  to as the Heartwoods, and include dryads, hamadryads, and treants.  The second
   branch of the
  Triad are the spiritual followers of Mielikki, known as the Arms of the
  Forest. The
  Forestarms, as they are often called, are the closest fit to the traditional
  priests found
  throughout the Realms. Although they are not druids, Forestarms serve a
  similar role
  protecting the forests of the world.  The third branch of the Triad are the
  physical followers
  of Mielikki, known as the Needles. The Needles are rangers, who act as the
  warrior arm of
  the faith, and serve a defensive role protecting the forests from marauders,
  hurnanoids, and
  the followers of the god Malar.  Included in this branch is a small religious
  order of
  woodland knights such as the Shadoweirs.

  Finally the lay followers of Mielikki include many woodsmen, the occasional
  elf (especially
  wood elves), a few bards, and many of the Harpers, a secretive organization
  for good located
  in the northern Realms.  Following are several kits/specialty priesthoods in
  AD&D2 game
  terms designed specifically for NPC and PC followers of Mielikki.

  Arms of the Forest
  Tlle Forestarms serve as the priestly branch of the faithflll of Mielikki.
  These priests have
  many of the same powers as druids, although their outlook is more oriented
  towards the
  protection of nature (and forests in particular) from the forces of evil and
  ignorance. Many of
  these priests can be found wandering among small communities nestled at the
  edges of forests
  both great and small.  They seek to teach humalls and other goodly races to
  care and respect
  the trees, and the life beneath their leafy bows. They try to prevent further
  encroachment by
  civilization on the remaining great forests by teaching careful forest
  husbandry. When called
  upon, they will defend the forest with force of arms if necessary.  The
  leaders of the
  Forestarms are often female, though there are many males among their numbers.
    Humans,
  elves, and half-elves serve as such priests, although technically there are no
   prohibitions
  against any race serving as a priest of Mielik~l.


  ARMS OF THF FORFSTS; (FORFSTARMS)
   Portfolio: Protection of the Forests (Worships Mielikki)
  Requirements: Wisdom 14, Charisma 12; alignment NG
  Weapons Allowed: club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar, sling, staff
  Armor allowed: chain mail, elven chain mail, studded leather, leather
  Major Spheres: All, Animal, Healing, Plant, Weather, Sun
  Minor Spheres: Divination, Elemental
  Magical Items Allowed: as priest or ranger (subject to above restrictions)
  Granted Powers & Requirements:
  * Forestarms may not turn or command undead.
  * Forestarms are skilled woodsmen, just like rangers, and receive the tracking
   proficiency for
  free.  This skill improves for them just as it does for rangers.
  * Forestarms have the same skill with trained and untamed animals as do
  rangers of the same
  level.
  * Forestarms gain proficiency in both elvish and common at no cost.
  * All Forestarms may cast a variant of the first level priest spell analyze
  magic (ToM) at will.
  This ability works only on forested areas (not characters, creatures, or
  objects).  Through the
  use of this ability forestarms are able to detect if the ecology of a forested
   area is seriously
  disrupted.
  * As with druids, Forestarms can pass through overgrown areas (thick thorn
  bushes, tangled
  vines, briar patches, etc.) without leaving a trail and at a normal movement
  rate after reaching
  third level.
  * As with druids, Forestarms are immune to charm spells cast by woodland
  creatures (dryads,
  nixies, etc.) after reaching 7th level.

Due to its size, this text item will be continued in the next text item.

------------------------------ Start of body part 5

  Raiment: Ceremonial dress of the followers of Mielikki is a simple tabard and
  trousers with a
  short cape. The shirt is usually short-sleeved, but long-sleeved in winter.
  The symbol of
  Mielikki is worn over the heart.  The colors of the ceremonial garb vary with
  the seasons,
  each season having a base color and an accent. Winter is white with green
  accents, spring
  green with yellow accents, summer yellow with red accents, and fall red with
  white accents.
  New Spells:  In addition to their normal complement of priest spells, when
  selecting their
  spells, Forestarms may also select from the following list: call woodland
  beings and commune
  with nature.

  Needles
  The Needles are an organization of rangers based primarily in the north.
  Their members
  include elves, halfelves, and humans. In addition to their normal skills, they
   gain bonus
  non-weapon proficiencies in elvish and common. In addition to their normal
  selection of
  spells, once they are able to cast priest spells, needles can also select from
   the spell call
  woodland beings.

  Shadoweirs
  Named for the greatest trees of the forests, the shadowtops and the weirwoods
  (see September
  1987 Dragon), this is a highly secretive branch of the faith that originated
  in the northern
  reaches of the High Forest. Its rnembers consist solely of half-elven
  multi-classed
  priest/rangers, and its membership has spread beyond the ~igh Forest,
  throughout all of Faer~m.
  The Shadoweirs serve as a sort of religious knighthood of the woods. Unlike
  the Arms of the
  Forest or even the Needles, the Shadoweirs serve as an activist and
  proselytizing order who
  are willing to go on the offensive in the behalf of their sacred forests. In a
   sense, the
  Shadoweirs serve as a sort of woodland paladin. Moreover, they seek to advance
   the regrowth
  of ancient forests reduced by civllization. Many shadoweirs are adventurers,
  wandering the
  Realms with missionary zeal. They seek to halt the endless assault of
  civilization on their
  ancient homelands.

  Any character taking this specialty priest kit/class must be a half-elf of NG
  alignment.
  Advancement ollows the normal rules for a multi-classed priest/ranger.

  SHADOWEIR; Portfolio: Knight of the Forests (Worships Mielikki)
  Requirements: Strength 13, Dexterity 13, Constitution 14, Wisdom 14, Charisma
  12;
  alignment NG
  Weapons Allowed: any; prefer swords, bows, spears, lances, and quarterstaff
  Armor allowed: any; prefer chain mail, elven chain mail, studded leather
  Major Spheres: All, Animal, Combat, Healing, Plant, Weather, Sun
  Minor Spheres: Divination, Elemental, Protection
  Magical Items Allowed: as priest or ranger
  Granted Powers & Requirements:
  * Shadoweirs may not turn or command undead.
  * Shadoweirs gain all the abilities of rangers.
  * Shadoweirs must follow the ranger experience point progression in both their
   ranger and
  priest classes. Their bonus hit points due to constitution are calculated as
  if they are warriors
  (i.e a shadoweir with a 17 Constitution will get +3 hp / level).
  * Shadoweirs gain proficiency in both elvish and common at no cost.
  * All shadoweirs may cast a variant of the first level priest spell analyze
  magic (ToM) at will.
  This ability works only on forested areas (not characters, creatures, or
  objects).  Through
  the use of this ability shadoweirs are able to detect if the ecology of a
  forested area is
  seriously disrupted. Shadoweirs are obligated to attempt to correct the
  imbalance, even if this
  requires them to go against the local law of the region Shadoweirs are
  obligated to use this
  ability at any time they think a region could be ecologically out of balance.
  * Before advancing in level as a priest and a ranger, Shadoweirs must correct
  an ecological
  imbalance of significance proportional to their level (as decided by the DM).
  * As with druids, shadoweirs can pass through overgrown areas (thick thorn
  bushes, tangled
  vines, briar patches, etc.) without leaving a trail and at a normal movement
  rate after reaching
  third level in both classes .
  * As with paladins, shadoweirs may call for a war horse upon reaching 4th
  level in both
  classes, or anytime thereafter. This faithful steed need not be a horse; it
  may be whatever sort
  of creature is appropriate to the character (as decided by the DM). Note
  female shadoweirs
  often receive a unicorn for a mount, assuming they are of acceptable status to
   the unicorn. A
  shadoweir's war horse is a very special animal, bonded by fate to the warrior.
   The shadoweir
  does not really ~call~ the animal, nor does the horse instantly appear in
  front of him. Rather the
  character must find his war horse in some memorable way, most frequently by a
  specific
  quest.
  * As with druids, shadoweirs are immune to charm spel]s cast by woodland
  creatures (dryads,
  nixies, etc.) after reaching 7th level in both classes.
  * As with druids, a shadoweir gains the ability to shapechamge into a reptile,
   bird, or
  mammal once per day after reaching 9th level in both classes. The size can
  vary from that of
  a bullfrog or a small bird to as large as a black bear. Upon assuming a new
  form, the
  shadoweir heals 10 to 60 percent of all damage he has suffered (round
  fractions down). The
  shadoweir can only assume the form of a normal (real world) animal in its
  normal
  proportions, but by doing so he takes on all of that creature's
  characteristics its movement
  rate and abilities, its Armor Class, number of attacks, and damage per attack.
   The shadoweir~s
  clothing and one item held in each hand become part of the new body; these
  ~eappear when
  the shadoweir resumes his normal shape.  The items cannot be used while the
  shadoweir is in
  animal form.
  Raiment:  Shadoweirs prefer suits of gleaming chainmail or studded leather
  armor. Many
  powerful forest knights wear ancient suits of elven chain mail they have been
  given by elven
  lords for their efforts in defending the forests. During ceremonies, they wear
   chainmail and
  deep forest green cloaks weaved by dryads from the leaves of the great trees.
  Their symbol is
  of a giant shadowtop tree with a pair of crossed swords ovemaying it.
  New Spells:  In addition to their normal complement of priest spells, when
  selecting their
  spells, Shadoweirs may also select from the following list: call woodland
  beings and
  commune with nature.

  TORM

  Torm the True is the Lord of Duty, Loyalty, and obedience. Torm figured
  significantly in the
  struggle over the Tablets of Fate during the Time of Troubles. Torm manifested
   himself in
  Faerun in the city of Tantras, across the Dragonreach from the Dalelands, and
  was destroyed
  as he defeated the avatar of Bane during a titanic struggle. Following the
  return of the Tablets
  of Faith to the Overgod Ao, Torm was reformed by Lord Ao since he had died in
  service to
  his ethos.  Prior to his battle with Bane, Lord of Strife, Torm discovered a
  great evil being
  done in his name by his then current high priest named Tenwealth. The
  followers of Torm
  had always dominated the religious and political activity of Tantras, but
  during the time of
  Torm's Coming, they began to actively persecute all unbelievers (i.e.
  followers of other gods).
  With the aid of the fallen cleric of Sune named Adon, Torm implicated the
  chief conspirators,
  and accused them of their crimes.  Torm absorbed the souls of many of his true
   worshippers,
  including the heretical clergy leaders, and assumed the form of a monstrous
  lion-headed man.
  He then battled Bane in a battle of mutual destruction, in the process
  destroying the besieging
  Zhentarim navy and creating many magic dead areas.  Torm, along with Ilmater,
  serves Tyr,
  Lord of Justice, in many of that god's endeavors.  Many legends tell of Torm,
  who normally
  roams the Prime Material Plane, engaged in heroic combats with legendary
  monsters. Torm
  seems to often serve a role of champion or chief paladin of Tyr.  Chief among
  the followers
  of Torm are knights and warrior priests who seek to emulate his steadfast
  commitment to
  duty and tireless battle against evil. The followers of Torm have temples in
  many major cities
  of the Realms, and many individual Tormites may be encountered wandering the
  Realms on
  various missions of their god.  The followers of Torm organize themselves into
   a three level
  hierarchy of worshippers.  The top hierarchy includes the clergy of Torm, who
  are arranged
  in their own strict hierarchy. These priests are referred to formally as the
  Disciples of Torm,
  and serve as the main organization of the faithful.  The second hierarchy
  includes the
  religious warriors of Torm. This group serves as the warrior arm of Torm's
  clergy, and go on
  many quests in the service of Torm. The members of this group are known as the
   Swords of
  Torm, and most (if not all) of its members are cavaliers. (See the CFH section
   on warrior
  kits.) Included in this hierarchy is an order of paladins in Torm's service
  known as the Order
  of the Golden Lions, which are detailed below.  Finally, the third level of
  the hierarchy
  includes the lay followers of Torm.

  Torm's faithful include many warriors and government officials, among others.
  Following the
  Time of Troubles, many have made pilgrimages from all over the Realms to the
  Temple of
  Torm's Coming, located in northern Tantras.  Torm's followers are expected to
  make yeamy
  tithes to the local temple of Torm as they are able. In addition, they are
  supposed to follow
  the general religious tenets of Torm, as espoused by his clergy.  Following
  the Time of
  Troubles, the religious hierarchy of Torm's faithful was completely
  overhauled.  Incensed by
  his followers persecution of other goodly religions, Torm has dictated a
  series of
  responsibilities and obligations for his followers. These duties are
  collectively referred to as
  the Penance of Duty, detailed below.

  Penance of Duty
  * Debt of Persecution: Followers of Torm are obliged to undertake the Debt of
  Persecution.
  To repay their persecution of other religions, the truly faithful must aid
  other goodly religions
  reestablish themselves.
  * Debt of Dereliction: Followers of Torm are obliged to alleviate themselves
  of the abdication
  of duty in guarding against strife. To alleviate this debt, Tormites must
  expend all possible
  effort to eliminate any surviving cults of Bane, as well as oppose all efforts
   of Cyricists and
  the ~hentarim .
  * Debt of Destruction: Followers of Torm are obliged to relieve the
  destruction to the magic
  weave incurred during the Time of Troubles. All 'magic dead~ areas are to be
  reported and
  repaired. In addition, all permanent results of the magical chaos are to be
  similamy undone.
  (Note that this Debt has been interpreted, probably incorrectly, as a  command
   to eradicate
  any new species appearing following the Time of Troubles.)

  Following are several kits/specialty priesthoods in ADhD2 game terms designed
  specifically
  for NPC and PC followers of Torm.

  Disciples of Torm
  The Disciples of Torm serve as the clergy of the faithful of Torm. These
  priests are described
  fully in the Forgotten Realms appendix, and that description is partially
  duplicated below.  In
  general they are required to actively implement and coordinate efforts and
  actions dictated by
  the Penance of Duty.  Currently, the Disciples of Torm are exclusively human,
  and the
  majority are male.  However there is no evidence in the teachings of Torm that
   these are
  requirements of his clergy.

  DISCIPLE OF TORM

  Portfolio: Duty, Loyalty, Obedience (Worships Torm)
  Requirements: Constitution 12, Wisdom 15; alignment LG (LN)
  Weapons Allowed: as cleric
  Armor allowed: any
  Major Spheres: All, Astral, Combat, Divination, Guardian, Healing, Protection,
   Summoning,
  Sun
  Minor Spheres: Charm, Elemental, Necromantic, Weather
  Magical Items Allowed: as cleric
  Granted Powers & Requirements:
  * Specialty priests of Torm may turn undead as priests. They may also command
  the undead
  to perform tasks, such as guarding a passageway, without endangering their
  alignment.
  * Henchmen following a specialty priest of Torm treat that priest as if his
  Charisma was 18
  for purposes of determining loyalty, provided that those henchmen worship (or
  at least
  recognize the power of) Torm.
  * The duration of divination and protection spells is doubled when the spell
  is cast by a
  specialty priest of Torm. Of course, a permanent spell is still permanent.
  * Specialty priests of Torm may use the command spell once per day, at will.
  * Specialty priests of Torm are required to follow the Penance of Duty without
   fail, and
  before advancing in level, serve in some fashion that helps alleviate one of
  the debts
  mentioned in the Penance of Duty.
  Raiment:  The ceremonial costume of the Disciples of Torm is the same in the
  field as in the
  temple - a full suit of battle armor with an ornate helm, kept in
  well-polished shape. Rank
  within the church hierarchy is shown by the color tints of the armor - orich
  church approved
  shaded inks rubbed into the metal itself. The lowest rank has a bloodstained
  red similar to
  that of Tempurans, then rising (according to local customs) to sunrise orange,
   harvest yellow,
  dragon green, and a sky blue for the patriarches of the faith. The greatest
  heroes of Torm are
  entitled to have a dusky purple polish rubbed onto their armor.

  Order of the Gollden Lions
  Following Torm's rebirth, the clergy of Torm founded a new order of paladins
  to serve as
  holy warriors of Torm. These champions are specially dedicated to serving the
  Penance of
  Duty, and wander the Realms in Torm's service. Failure to actively serve the
  spirit and
  meaning of the Penance of Duty will result in a loss of paladinhood,
  regainable only by a
  difficult quest in the service of Torm according to the goals of the Penance
  of Duty.  In
  AD&D2 terms, members of this order are 'specialty paladins~ in the tradition
  of ~specialty
  priests'. Many are also cavaliers or noble warriors as detailed in the CFH.

  PALADIN OF TORM;, ORDER OF THE GOLDEN LIONS
  Portfolio: Duty, Loyalty, Obedience (Worships Torm)
  Requirements: Strength 12, Constitution 12, Wisdom 15, Charisma 17; alignment
  LG

   Summoning,
  Sun
  Minor Spheres: Charm, Elemental, Necromantic, Weather
  Magical Items Allowed: as paladin
  Granted Powers & Requirements:
  * Specialty paladins of Torm have all the normal abilities and restrictions of
   paladins as
  detailed in the Player's Handbook.
  * Specialty paladins of Torm may turn undead as paladins. They may also
  command the
  undead to perform tdsks, such as guarding a passageway, without emdangering
  their
  alignment.
  * The duration of divination and protection spells is doulbled when the spell
  is cast by a
  specialty paladin of Torm. of course, a permanent spell is still permallent .
  * Specialty paladins of Torm may use the command spell once per day, at will.
  * Specialty paladins of Torm are required to follow the Penance of Duty
  without fail, and
  before advancing in level, serve in some fashion that helps alleviate one of
  the debts
  mentioned in the Penance of Duty.
  * Specialty paladins of Torm may receive the equivalent of a priest's minor
  quest spell during
  times of strife at their Lord Torm's discretion. This power will never be
  granted more than
  once per month.
  * The paladin receives the ability to roar like a lion. The effect of this
  lion's roar is
  equivalent to the eighth level mage spell great shout detailed in the
  Forgotten Realms
  Adventures hardcover.
  Raiment:  The ceremonial costume of the Order of the Golden Lions is the same
  in the field
  as in the temple - a full suit of battle armor with an ornate helm, kept in
  wellpolished shape,
  with a dusky purple polish rubbed onto their armor.

  Moon Guards
  Portfolio: Protectors of Night Travellers (Worshi~ers of Mystra and Selune)
  Requirements: Intelligence 15; Wisdom 17; any good alignment
  Armor: None
  Weapons: as a mage, plus the firts new weapon they take must be a short bow.
  Major Spheres: All, Astral, Divination, Gaurdian, Healing, Necromantic,
  Protection,
  Summoning, Sun, Travelers, Wards, Weather
  Minor Spheres: None
  Granted Powers: - +l to saves vs. spells - gains the spell craft prof. without
   usingf a slot
  - can turn undead normally
  - granted 30 feet infravision
  -can turn lycanthropes as they turn undead.
  Other Notes: Moon Gaurds (I hate the Name too) are a dual class character.
  They Must have
  been a mage or a specialist mage who has attained 6th level before switching
  to the priest
  clas.  They can take this class any time thereafter, and cease gaining
  experience as a mage.
  They do NOT, however, lose the ability to use their mage powers. They operate
  as both
  classes whatever priest level they are. They do NOT, however, gain new
  proficiencies or hit
  points until they surpass their origional level. And, finally, they can only
  cast their priest
  spells beneath the night sky.  (This offsets the use of their mage abilities,
  as well as the
  number of major spheres).

  This religion is a small secretive sect dedicated to those who travel by
  night.  The church is
  not very organized - they have no temples of their own (being content to
  worship under the
  light of the moon), but they are welcome amoung the priests and priestsesses
  fo either
  Goddess.  They fight as a priest of their level, and wander the night looking
  to aid those in
  trouble. They will help fight off bandits and monsters - usually asking for
  nothing in return.
  They will not ignore a night time cry for aid, and most often travel alone.

  Priests;: Wrath Priests
  Portfo1io: Destruction (Worships the Gods of Fury: Auril, malar and Umbemee)
  Requirements. Strength 13; Wisdom 12; Constitution 15; alignment CE
  Weapons A110wed. Any weapon doing a minimum of 1 d8 damage
  Armor allowed. Any
  major Spheres: All, Chaos, Combat, Elemental (only when used to destroy),
  Healing (reversed
  versions only - no healing), Weather
  Minor Spheres: Animal, Creation (Reversed only), Necromantic (No positive
  spells - may use
  the spell "slay living"), Plant, Summoning
  Magica1 Items Allowed. as cleric
  Granted Powers:
  - may turn/command undead normally
  - control weather once per day by making it one category worse than the
  present (as PHB pg
  232)
  - May incite a destructive rage in any one creatre/round. The attack is a
  combination
  gaze/spoken suggestion (if the creature can not see or hear then the attacks
  results in a fear
  spell) The victim must save vs. paralyzation or follow a single command from
  the Wrath
  pertaining to the destruction of something (i e. burn this building, destroy
  this field, or kill
  everyone you meet.) for the next 4-10 rounds (2d4+2) If the save is
  successful, the subject
  has resisted and can not be affected for an entire day.
  - Wraths also have the ability to resist all of the effects of any
  destruction/disaster in which
  they have made a significant contribution. That is, they may stand before an
  oncoming

Due to its size, this text item will be continued in the next text item.

------------------------------ Start of body part 6

  tsunami and not get a single drop wet, or they may stand in a collapsing mine,
   only to have a
  shaft to the surface open up above them, etc..
  - They are also immune to mind affecting magic, this does not include
  illusions, but it does
  include most enchantment/charm spells.
  Other Notes: This specialty priest is actually created at 10th level from any
  of the specialty
  priests of either Malar, Auril, or Umbemee. Thus it is very Rare. At 9th level
   or beyond a
  specialty priest of one of those Powers may find themselves in the midst of a
  disaster that
  they created with no way for them to escape alive. If this is the case, and
  the disaster is large
  enough (sometimes this is arranged by the powers that be) a manifistation of
  the God may
  appear out of the middle of the chaos and award the priest for his service
  just before he
  passes out. He will awaken following the disaster wounded and in pain, on the
  shore of a
  hurricane destroyed island or from the embers of a burned building. He will
  instantly
  understand that he is to replace one of the older Wraths.

  There mav on1v be thirteen of them in the Realms at anv given time. and when
  one goes
  astray a new one is needed to replace him. (Sometimes the new priest is called
   upon to
  actually detroy the old) The new priest now has NONE of the granted powers of
  this
  priesthood and will refuse to use any weapon that does not do at least the
  aforementioned
  damage (even subjecting himself to proficiency penalties to do so), and all of
   his spells will
  be granted from the new spheres. He does not gain these Granted powers until
  he has proven
  himself worthy by advancing one level through the destruction of everything
  and anything he
  can think of.

  These priests are the true powers of destruction in the realms. It is said
  that there is not a
  disaster without their hand in it somewhere.

  They are feared by everyone - even the priests of the Gods of Fury. The only
  ones who they
  see on their own level are the Stormlords of Talos, and this is only out of
  respect for the God
  (Whom they also serve indirectly) They are "welcome" in all of these churches,
   and may
  demand food, shelter, and assistance from these places for as many days as
  they have levels.
  (The temples of Talos will usually deand a service in return, if the Wrath's
  plans do not
  alredy fir the bill.) At least every other period of as many days as the
  priest has levels these
  priests must destroy the life or lives of at least one person or persons. They
   can do this in as
  many ways as possible. Burning a farmer's crops, then terrorizing and killing
  off his family,
  taking his health, and finally allowing him to live in poverty and sorrow.
  After such a trek,
  the priests has a number of days equal to his level to rest.

  Also once each season he must cause a disaster that effets at least twice the
  number of people
  that he has levels. If a priest fails to do so, he loses all special abilities
   and does not gain
  spells until this requirement is met. If the priest fails again, he loses all
  powers forever and
  will be destroyed by the Gods and a new initaite will be selsected. This is
  done wothout
  mercy.

  Wraths prefer to dress for ceremony in their own unique clothes always black
  with white or
  silver highlights, and arching collars, drastic cuffc, ornaments, etc... All
  priests must be chaotc
  evil.  Their symbol is a small shattered skull made out of silver and embeded
  into an amulet
  of obsidian.  This will be found on the priest upon waking up after his
  "vision", and the priest
  on the way out will find his to have disappeared, if he is not yet dead.

  New Spells: may include - summon tsunami, create inferno, wither, and a
  version of Beltan's
  Burning Blood.

  Peregrin's Treatise;;

  Although fixed portals have existed in the Astral plane long before
  recorded time, even before Gith liberated her children from the
  illithids, no one devoted much time to studying them before archmage
  Peregrin Graycloak decided to settle in the Silver Realm. Long after his
  fleet of void cruisers had become a reality (see "Voidjammers," DRAGON~
  magazine #159), Peregrin pursued the mystery of fixed portals.
  Peregrin's Treatise can be used by any wizard (or psionicist with
  access to the Psychoportation discipline) of at least 10th level. This
  work describes how to create (or destroy) a permanent, stable gate
  between any reality and the Astral Plane. The instructions in this book
  are written in a special magical script that cannot be copied without
  destroying the book.

  To successfully open a gate, the builder must be personally familiar
  with both end points of the gate. The portal builder must assemble rare

Due to its size, this text item will be continued in the next text item.

------------------------------ Start of body part 7

  magical inks and powdered components from the destination plane (taking 1-4
  weeks and
  costing no less that 50,000 gp, plus 5,000 gp per level below 18th) and
  inscribe elaborate
  magical runes at each of the portal's intended end points.
  Drawing the inscriptions at each of the gate's end points takes at
  least one week, plus one week per level of the caster below 18. Once the
  inscriptions are properly completed (roll an Intelligence check), the
  ritual for creating a gate takes an entire week, permanently drains the
  caster of one point of Constitution, and ages him for 10% of his natural
  life span (all regardless of success). The base chance of success for an
  18th-level wizard or psionicist is 95%; for each level below 18,
  subtract 5% from the chance of success and add 5% to the chance of
  catastrophic failure.


  For example, a 12th-level wizard decides to create a portal between
  the Forgotten Realms and the Astral plane using the rites described in
  Peregrin's Treatise. After studying the book for at least a month, he
  consults the apotheca ries in Calimport and rounds up the desired
  components in three weeks, spending 80,000 gp in the process. The wizard
  spends the next seven weeks inscribing the runes in the Astral plane and
  in the Realms, and then spends an additional week performing the rite,
  losing a point of Constitution and aging 10 years. Even after all this
  time and effort, he has only a 65% chance of success, and a 30% chance
  of catastrophic failure (perhaps gating in a powerful creature from the
  Lower Planes that is not at all happy about being summoned or even
  gating the wizard himself to the Lower Planes).
  The final chapter of the book describe how to destroy a fixed portal.
  The essen tial step requires finding the keyrune at the heart of the
  rune network inscribed when the fixed portal was created (there is one
  keyrune on each side of the gate). If the keyrune on either side is
  located, the fixed portal can be destroyed by successfully casting a
  dispel magic spell on the keyrune, against a spell cast at the 18th level
  of experience (a dispel magic spell cast on the portal in general will
  have no effect).
  Peregrin did many experiments with psionics and determined that
  concentrating 500 PSPs on the keyrune via any destructive psionic
  discipline woul accomplish the same result.
  In the dedication, Peregrin's Treatise contains a short passage that
  can be used once per month as an "escape hatch." By reading it, the
  Treatise's owner can cast a rope trick spell that lasts for 24 hours on
  any plane.

  RUMORS & NEWS

  Forgotten Realms: Myth Drannor;-Time of Troubles

       A group of adventures became Harper heroes today, after single handedly
  killing not one, but THREE liches in the School of Wizardry(see FR boxed set
  for layout).  They were originally sent there over a year ago, when Lashan of

  Scardale fled there after his war with the dales.  On their first trip they
  only reported seeing one lich, but they escaped, bringing the captured Lashan

  with them.  It was then they were asked to return again, as a test to see
  if they were worthy of being Harpers.  Three weeks later they appeared in the

  village square seemingly out of thin air.  When questioned by Storm
  Silverhand,
  she heard a spectacular story of planar travel, and a battle with a group of
  githyanki.  The adventurers, led by an elven fighter mage, even produed a
  githyanki head, and one of their fabled two handed swords.  Storm, impressed
  with their bravery, made them Harpers. After a long layover, they were
  asked to go to Aglarond by Storm to look into some sort of business, and on
  the
  night of the fall of the gods, they were teleported there by Elminster
  himself.
       Unfortunately for them the adventurers would not make it there for
  another two weeks.  The instability in magic caused them to end up near
  Castle
  Perilous in Vaasa. Using two psionicists with dream travel, they headed south
  in leaps and bounds.  After reporting with the Simbul it is unknown what they

  did, but somehow, they returned to Shadowdale just three weeks after talking
  with her.  They returned bearing some very evil magical items, including an
  evil staff of the magi, but also with the heads of not one but THREE liches.
       According to rumor, they were magically teleported from some inn in
  Telflamm, and brought to the School of Wizardry.  It is thought by most that
  the instability in magic aided, not hindered this group of adventurers.
       Currently, the adventurers are resting three miles north of Shadowdale
  in a small dugout house.



  Sea of Fallen Stars; (Pirate Isles;)
  After the death of the Half-Orcish leader and its Green Dragon protector at
  the
  hands of an adventuring party, the pirate town of Scrape has fallen into a
  state of chaos and confusion as various factions struggle to claim
  leadership.
  No less than four factions comprised of Humans, Ogres, Orcs, and Goblins are
  at
  war with each other on the small Pirate Isle.

  FR: Mirabar
  The adventurers known as the Bloodhawks have returned in triumph to Mirabar
  aboard a flying ship.  The vessal's holds were filled to the rim with
  platinum,
  gold, and silver obtained from the lair of a Red Dragon.  At the request of
  the
  party's leader, Deltar the Destroyer, a drydock was built and the vessal
  landed
  outside of the city.  After seeing to the ressurection of one of thier number

  who had fallen to the Dragon's breath, and removing the 'helm' that allowed
  the
  ship to fly, the Bloodhawks donated the wooden galley to the city and rode to
  the south.

  FR: Scardale
  A sea-going vessal belonging to the Zhentarim was attacked and stolen by
  unknown parties in a fierce battle on Scardale's wharves.  At the end of the
  melee, several Zhentilar were dead, including a mage and a priest of Cyric,
  and
  the vessal was sailing away to the north.  The Black Network is rumored to be
  actively seeking the culprits, and have offered a 1,000 gold piece reward for
  information leading to the bloody and painful death of those responsible.

  FR:Moonshaes; (outer planes;)
  A well known group of adventurers have traveled to the plane of hades to
  reclaim the now lost soul of Tristan Kendrik.  They have enlisted the help
  of the Mage Flamsterd, and another unknown sage called Gregor.  Gregor
  seems to hold vast knowledge of the outer planes, and of the resident powers.
  All that is known is that he was first seen in Waterdeep soon after the death
  of Myrkul in the Time of the Avatars.  The group has returned empty handed
  with two of their number dead, thought to be now restored.  They now plan
  on returning to Hades with new information to where their King's soul lies.

  FR:RAVENS BLUFF;:
  Some adventurers from the Company of the White Raven accidently visited
  Maztica
  recently when the ship they were travelling on was swallowed by a giant sea
  monster.
  When the elven mage Kitiram cast a Flaming Sphere against the monster's
  stomach
  lining, a survival mechanism teleported the ship randomly, causing it to
  appear
  above a desert.  Gravity took over, and the ship smashed into the surface,
  killing
  most of the crew and severely injuring the adventuring group.

  Fortunately, the survivors were discovered by some friendly natives, and after
  establishing rudimentary communications, they discovered they were in Maztica.
  The group set out to discover a way to travel back to Ravens Bluff.  After a
  series
  of adventures, the group found a spelljamming helm.  This helm was mounted on
  a
  ship, and the group left Maztica, taking some willing natives with them.

  The return to Ravens Bluff caused some consternation, as the pilot failed to
  handle
  the helm properly, crashing the ship into a house, destroying the ship and
  house
  in the process.  No loss of life occurred and damages were paid for by the
  Company.

  CONTACT: Chris Ryan (chrisr@fitmail.fit.qut.edu.au)

  Now any interested DM can contact me for more information if they want.  I can
   then
  supply information on the White Raven Company, the elven mage Kitiram, the
  monster,
  the adventures in Maztica, the spelljamming helm, the returning natives, etc.

  Forgotten Realms:Cormyr;:   CARAVANS AMBUSHED!

       In the past two rides, a total of four caravans have been ambushed
  and plundered while making the run through Gnoll Pass.  The only survivor
  tells of a pitched battle between the caravan's guards and a large combined
  force of orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, and ogres.  Baron Thomdor, commander of
  Castle Crag, suspects Zhentarim influence, because as everyone knows,
  humanoids can't cooperate on making dinner, let alone coordinating a military
  operation of this magnitude.  Various adventuring bands have been hired to
  find the humanoids and destroy the operation.  A fake caravan manned by
  Purple Dragon's will also attempt to draw out the humanoids and expose
  their leaders.

  Forgotten Realms: Baldur's Gate;: Unicorn Controversy
  Tran, a noted alchemist in Baldur's Gate, has put out advertisements
  for unicorn horns.  Despite massive protests by noted druids and rangers,
  a large party brought in two horns and was paid hansomely, in cash
  and gems.  The Moon Blades, a group of nearby Druids, contacted Tran
  with the intent of having him revoke the advertisement.  Two druids
  went to have a "talk" with him and have not been seen from since.

  Adventurers go Hunting Trolls - On Purpose!

  FR:EVENINGSTAR;:
  Two foolhardy adventurerst ought it would be "fun" to go hunting
  trolls, so off they went into the southern part of the Stonelands
  a few days east of Eveningstar.  They apparently spend two days
  trying to attract a troll, they were very successful, for three
  fully grown trolls attacked out of the bush. The elf, whose idea
  it was, was rendered unconscious in the attack. His dwarven
  companion managed to fell the trolls and burn their bodies.

  After healing his companion with healing draughts, the furious
  dwarf dragged his embarrassed colleague back to Eveningstar
  where they were heard to be solemnly swearing to never do
  that again.


  FR:Baldour;:
  The Dwarves of Baldour report that one of the Swords of Baldour has
  been stolen. Emissaries have been sent to investigate its
  sighting in Waterdeep.

  FR:Eveningstar;:
  An ancient axe, the dwarven Axe of Thrammer, has been rumoured to
  appeared in Eveningstar and also in Waterdeep. This huge axe that
  hits like a 2-handed sword, was being made about 700 years ago
  for the Dwarven prince Thrammer, but he and the axe disappeared
  during the 17th Dwarf/Orc war. The axe is not magical but was intended
  to be enchanted, but was put into use when the Orcs attacked.

  FR:Waterdeep;:
  There as been a flood of Maztican gold and silver on the market
  in Waterdeep recently as adventurers return from the jungles
  of The Death Zone.

  FR:?:
  The Church of Helm denies reports that a Helm missionary tried
  to raise an army of Maztican warriors.

  FR:Waterdeep;:
  The recent restrictions on magic weaponry in Waterdeep appears
  to have created a thriving black market in evil-baby-killing-
  assault-swords. Loyal citizens are requested to report any knowledge
  of magic weapons to the authorities.




  FR: Silverymoon; toward Ascore:
  A group of adventurers are currently going to Ascore on their way to
  the Pillar of Thoras located deep in the Anauroch desert where an
  powerful oracle is rumored to be located. As they are nearing Ascore,
  an earthquake (the first in centuries since the creation of Anauroch
  itself by the Phaerims) shake the region. Strange undead (like semi
  intelligent skeleton) are seen stalking the party, but always from
  distance. They are nearing the hill caverns that lead down to Ascore.
  They hope to learn there the location of one of the Seven Swords of
  Wayland.

  FR: Pirate Isles;:   Conditions have worsened in the war-torn town of
  Scrape.  An alliance between the Goblins and Orcs temporarily
  threatened to push the balance of power in favor of the Humanoid
  Faction, but the sudden appearence of a force of Grey Dwarves acting
  in support of the Humans of Scrape has thrown things into chaos once
  more.  The month long conflict has even spilled out to sea as pirate
  vessals acting in support of the various factions have begun attacking
  each other through out the isles.  The overall effect has been a
  reduction in pirate attacks in the Sea of Fallen Stars and an increase
  in trade for Sembia, Cormyr, and other nations bordering the Sea.

  FR: Scardale;:  The Zhentarim have increased thier reward for
  information on those responsible for the capture of one of thier
  vessals in Scardale last month to 2,000 gold.  A FNN Bard-on-the-Scene
  interviewed Anton Longstride, a Ranger from the woods north of
  Scardale who reports seeing "A big black boat like the one the Zhents
  lost" sailing into Brock's Cove last week.  "Loaded up a gang of
  Bugbears, Ogres, and Frost Giants and sailed away to the south, it
  did." he added.  Anton goes on to say that he SWEARS he saw a couple
  of elves leading the humanoids, but our Bard-on-the-Scene comments
  that the Ranger had partaken of several drinks by that time and might
  not be entirly credible.

           Daggerford Local Baron's daughter rescued by militia
                 from sacrifice by coven of evil witches.

  Forgotten Realms: Daggerford;: A group of Elite Daggerford Militia
  turned up to the small village of Clearwater as guests of Baron Perne
  at his daughter's wedding, only to discover she was missing.
  Extensive investigation has revealed that she was under an enchantment
  by a local witch, and had been kidnapped.  She was intended as a
  victim in a ritual sacrifice at an evil stronghold east of Secomber,
  but fortunately the militia group rescued her, having to defeat a
  whole coven of witches in the process.  The wedding took place a few
  days later than planned.

  FR: Kara-Tur;: Chunming;:
  The spelljamming; port of Chunming was under strict control for the
  early part of the month before last - NO ships were being allowed to
  leave and ALL new arrivals were being warned off. The city was under
  quarantine, and, as far as could be gathered, all persons who had
  encountered the crew of the vessels "Frostfire" and "Phoenix" were
  being requested to come forward, or being searched out, and were
  subjected to intensive magical examination, and in some cases, were
  not seen again. Indication of the seriousness with which the Chunming
  authorities were treating the problem was manifest when the sage and
  wizard Elminster, from the Western Realms, arrived to asist with
  investogations. Several buildings in the city had been razed to the
  ground with magical fire by the city authorities, apparently in an
  attempt to combat whatever the cause of the quarantine is.

  FR: Karatur: Chunming:
  City authorities, with the aid of some adventurers, have broken up a
  mysterious cult within the city. The cult's symbol is that of a
  stylised six-limbed humanoid, and as far as could be ascertained they
  are, or hopefully were, some kind of evil fertility cult

  The  adventuring group  SVG  (usually  known  as  Silly Vicious Goons)
  has  disappeared on Straitguard Island;  (about  2 weeks sailing south-
  east of Waterdeep;) while acting as a scouting party  for King Jaylith.
  Rumours of  drow involvement are  being denied by  official sources in
  the kingdom; the adventurer's  guild has declared the group  "missing,
  status unknown".   Any  person(s)   knowing the  whereabouts   of this
  adventuring group should report its  presence to the local guild hall:
  standard guild payment schedules will be followed.

  SVG  is  comprised  of two  dwarven fighters,   one human cleric,  one

                        "THE IV" GO AFTER THE FIVE

      It has been rumored that an evil efreet has awakened after  almost
  a  thousand  year  rest.  It  is  said that he can destroy much of the
  desert inhabitants,  and maybe farther  south.  Recently  a  group  of
  adventurers  calling  themselves "The IV" (consisting of 2 elves and 2
  humans) have gone in search of five magic Star Gems.  It is said  that
  these  gems will give them the power of the dead arch-mage Martek.  It
  was he who first banished the efreet almost one  thousand  years  ago.
  With this help they hope to send the efreet back to its home forever.
      Nothing  has  been  heard  from  them since I saw them on the road
  about a week ago.  They informed me that they had 3 gems and  were  on
  the  trail  of  the  fourth.  However I don't know if anything will be
  able to stop this evil that has come to our land.

      The troubled Pirate Isle that has been the site of a bloody  civil
  war  was  attacked  and  conquered  by  a  force of Ogres and Bugbears
  supported by a band of Frost Giants  and  led  by  a  pair  of  Elves.
  Details are sketchy at this time, but reports indicate that the Goblin
  and  Orc  populations  of  Scrape  have  been ruthlessly exterminated,
  whiles the Humans and Ogres native to the town have agreed to obey the
  new rulers.  An unconfirmed report also states that the lead vessal in
  the attack was the same one stolen from the Zhentarim at Scardale  two
  months  ago.  The  latest  report  available  from our Pegasus Express
  messengers say that the fighting has died down with  the  invaders  in
  complete  control.  The  new  rulers  of  Scrape  have yet to make any
  formal announcements as of yet but are expected to soon.

      A slew of attacks by trolls,  ankhegs,  and other monstrous beasts
  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  village of Eveningstar has been
  halted by a  band  of  adventurers  known  as  the  Swords  of  Light.
  Apparently  the surge of attacks,  unusual for the area,  was due to a
  minor artifact,  known as the Eye of the Basilisk,  that had  recently
  come  into the possession of the Temple of Lathander.  Unsubstantiated
  rumors hint that the Swords of Light may have  sold  the  Eye  of  the
  Basilisk  to  the temple in the first place and then stolen it several
  times in succession.

  have  recovered  the  third of four Elemental Blades from the dungeons
  beneath the city of Waterdeep.  Rumors claim that the  band  has  some
  affiliation  with  the  dark elves lairing beneath the city,  but this
  rumor is believed to be without basis in fact.  It is known  that  the
  band has not yet emerged from the main well of the Yawning Portal inn,
  and may have met a sinister fate beneath the city streets.

      Lord Moriarty and Lady Joleena,  both members of  the  Consortium,
  have  announced  that  they  will  renew  their  wedding  vows  on the
  Twentieth day in the  month  of  Flamerule.  This  announcement  comes

  chambermaids under the Moriarty's employ and a young, female, Moon Elf
  whom aspires to be a ranger.  Gordon, Right Hand of Lord Moriarty, has
  initiated a full investigation into the origins of the malicious lie.

      For reasons not yet disclosed,  a militant organization of  humans
  calling themselves The Pure,  have lay siege to the High Elven village
  of Hightree.  This attack has served as a pawn in the mounting  racial
  tensions  between  the Elven Races and Humans.  Based upon last year's
  registry of the organization, it is comprised of the following:

      A 19th-lvl fighter leading a 6th-lvl fighter, a 3rd-lvl fighter,
      20 cavalry, 100 infantry, and 20 berserkers

      A 16th-lvl fighter leading a 7th-lvl fighter, 30 cavalry, and 10
      mounted knights

      An 11th-lvl fighter leading a 5th-lvl fighter, 40 heavy
      crossbowmen, 20 light crossbowmen, and 20 expert archers

  A group of adventurers who were sent to investigate have reported that

      The hutment near the harbour of Loon Village  (Goliad  River)  was
  set  on fire under unknown circumstances.  During the day only beggars
  could be found in the huts but  it  is  rumored  that  at  nights  the
  hutment accomodated thieves,  assassins and other criminals.  The fire
  was put out due to enourmous efforts  of  the  residents  and  by  the
  guidance  of a group of young adventurers and two twin paladins,  thus
  saving the village's granary and wine-store,  located among the  huts,
  as well as the 80% of the hutment.  It also seems that the fire scared
  off the criminals who disappeared from the huts, although temporarily.

      The  ship  OSTRIA  that  was  expected  to  arrive at Trailsend on
  Friday,  March 15th,  seems to have disappeared.  The ship was routing
  on Goliad River, from the City of Goliad to Impiltur.  It was reported
  to  arrive normally on Wednesday,  March 13th at Heliogabalus where it
  stayed for 4 hours for supplies and then sailed South.  No  one  heard
  from it again.  OSTRIA was an old ship but capable for many more years
  of  sailing.  The  ship was property of the Barony of Bloodstone,  and
  Baron Gareth  Dragonsbane  is  rumored  to  be  very  annoyed  by  its
  disappearance.  The  ship  was  officially  reported to carry coal but
  some sailors in Loon Village said  that  it  looked  like  it  carried
  something  much  more  heavy.  If  the  rumors of the reopening of the
  bloodstone  mines  in  Galena  Mountains  are  correct,   there  is  a
  possibility  that  a huge amount of treasure has also been disappeared
  along with OSTRIA . . .

  POISONS

  Introduction
  -----------

  A saving throw versus poison is allowed in most situations involving the use
  of
  poison. If good, no further action will usually be required. If bad, the
  result
  will depend upon the type of poison (Table 1) and its operating mode (see
  narrative, following).

  Killing poisons
  ---------------

  Do as many points of damage as their strength rating.

  Retrogenic poisons
  ------------------

  Age a victim as many years as their strength rating. A system shock roll will
  also be required to avoid dying.

  Collagenic, debilitating, incapacitating,
  katabolic, lithogenic, psychomatic, and soporific poisons
  ---------------------------------------------------------

  These increase the victim[12]s score required to save vs poison by the amount
  of
  the poison[12]s strength rating. If the score required to save is then greater
   than
  20, the poison immediately takes effect.

  EXAMPLE: Sadric, a 5th level Wizard, is struck by a dart coated with a Type C
  soporific (sleep-inducing) poison. Sadric[12]s save vs poison is normally 14.
  He
  rolls a 9, failing his saving throw. A Type C poison has a strength rating of
  2d6. The GM rolls a 5 so Sadric[12]s save vs poison goes up to 19. Although
  Sadric
  failed his saving throw he doesn[12]t succumb to the poison as his saving
  throw
  score required is still less than or equal to 20. Next round Sadric gets hit
  again, fails his saving throw (he needed a 19) and this time the GM rolls a 6.
  Sadric[12]s saving throw vs poison goes up to 25! This is greater than 20 so
  the
  poison takes effect and Sadric falls asleep.

  Note that until eliminated, the score required to save vs poison increases
  with
  each subsequent infusion of poison.


  COLLAGENIC poisons; slow a victim for 2d4 rounds. The victim moves and attacks
  at one-half their normal rate. They have an Armour Class penalty of +4, an
  attack
  penalty of -4, and all Dexterity combat bonuses are negated.

  DEBILITATING poisons; weaken a victim for 1d3 days. All of their ability
  scores
  are halved during this time (apply appropriate adjustments to attack rolls,
  damage, Armour Class, etc.) and they move at one-half their normal movement
  rate. Furthermore, the victim cannot heal by normal or magical means until the
  poison is neutralised or its duration of effect has elapsed.

  INCAPACITATING poisons; leave a victim unable to move for 2d6 hours. Their
  body is limp, making it difficult for others to move them. The victim suffers
  no
  other ill effects from the poison but their condition can lead to quite a few
  problems for any companions.


Due to its size, this text item will be continued in the next text item.

------------------------------ Start of body part 9

  KATABOLIC poisons; reduce one ability score (randomly determined) by 1 point.

  LITHOGENIC poisons; turn a random body part into stone -

  d20     Part affected  Effects
  --------  -------------  -------
  1-4       Right leg      -2 to Dexterity, +50lbs weight, reduce move to 3"
  5-8       Left leg       Ditto
  9-11      Abdomen        -2 to hit, -2 to Dexterity, +2 to AC, +75lbs weight,
                           reduce move to 3"
  12        Chest          Vital organs turned to stone; die in one round unless
                           stone to flesh spell is applied
  13-15     Right arm      -2 to Dexterity, +50lbs weight
  16-18     Left arm       Ditto
  19-20     Head           Brain turned to stone; die in one round unless flesh
  to
                           stone spell is applied

  PSYCHOMATIC poisons; drain one life level from their victims.

  SOPORIFIC poisons; induce waves of weakness and lassitude. Victims move at
  half
  speed and suffer a +4 AC penalty during the round after being struck, then
  fall
  into a deep sleep lasting 2d4 hours. A good example of a soporific (Type E) is
  drow sleep poison (pp 89 90, The Drow of Underdark).



  Onset times
  -----------

  IMMEDIATE poisons activate the instant the poison is applied. Most monster
  poisons fall into this category. DELAY poisons activate after 2d6-2* minutes
  (the asterisk means roll again on doubles, adding the original and subsequent
  rolls together). SLOW poisons activate after 2d6-2* hours. DORMANT poisons
  activate after 2d6-2* days. HYPNOACTIVE poisons are triggered when the victim
  falls asleep (zzz...croak). VIGILACTIVE poisons activate when the victim wakes
  up. TRAUMATIC poisons activate the next time the victim loses one or more hit
  points. BINARY poisons activate only after the subsequent introduction of a
  triggering agent (e.g., first part is in the sweetmeats shared by everyone
  except the poisoner, the second part is in the wine shared by the victim and
  their poisoner. Separately the parts are harmless, but together...).

  Delivery methods
  ----------------

  INSINUATIVE poisons; must be injected into the bloodstream via sting, bite, or
  other penetration. INGESTIVE poisons are effective only if swallowed;
  assassins
  favour these for doctoring food and/or drink. INSPIRATIVE poisons are
  effective
  only if breathed in. CONTACT poisons need only touch the skin to be effective.
  SYNERGIC poisons are equally effective by any of the foregoing delivery
  methods.

  NB: although most insinuative poisons are also toxic if ingested, it is
  assumed
  that their taste, smell, or colour (and perhaps reduced potency) prevent their
  effective use as such.

  Creature size
  -------------

  Multiply the strength ratings of all but killing poisons by 25% vs size L
  creatures, 5% vs size H creatures, and 1% vs size G creatures.

  EXAMPLE: Martin the Myrmidon has three javelins coated with a Type Q
  incapacitating poison. He throws one at Bombadyr the Fire Giant, and hits.
  Bombadyr fails his save versus poison. The GM rolls 16 and 8 for a total of
  128.
  A Fire Giant is a size H creature so the poison is only 5% effective.
  Bombadyr[12]s
  saving throw score required is increased from 4 to 10.4 (5% of 128 = 6.4).
  Martin will have to hit Bombadyr at least two more times to have any hope of
  bringing him down (by poison alone).


  Blade venom
  -----------

  Evaporates quickly. During the first day after its application blade venom
  retains its full potency. By the second day its effectiveness is halved and by
  the third day, blade venom is ineffective. It is likewise removed by repeated
  use. After the first hit its effectiveness is halved. After the second hit it
  is gone.

  Partially evaporated or used poisons allow the victim a +4 on their saving
  throw roll.

  Eliminating poison
  ------------------

  Neutralise poison will reduce an abnormal saving throw score by 6d6 points.
  Poison otherwise dissipates naturally at the rate of 1d6 points per day
  (minimum
  result = Constitution hit point bonus).

  If a character with the herbalism proficiency is in attendance, the result
  will
  depend upon the outcome of a proficiency check. A critical success (a natural
  20) removes an extra 2d6 points per day. A good result removes an extra 1d6
  points. A bad result achieves nothing (try again the next day). With a
  critical
  failure (a natural 1), the patient suffers a relapse and incurs an extra 1d6
  points worth of poison.

  Whilst inactive poison remains in a victim[12]s body, natural healing takes
  twice
  as long.

  Classifying generic poisons
  ---------------------------

  Those with a +4 to save are rated as being equivalent to Type B.
  Those with a +1 or +2 to save, as Type C.
  Those with no adjustment either way can be rated as Type D.
  Those with up to a -4 to save, as Type E; and poisons that inflict damage
  even with a save or those that save at lower than -4 can be rated as being
  equivalent to Type F (or better).

  After reclassification, ignore any intrinsic saving throw adjustments.

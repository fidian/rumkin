<h3>Foreward</h3>

<p>The <i>Art of War</i> is the oldest military treatise in the world, 
yet still applicable to many things today.  This particular version is
a mixture of a couple different versions of English translations
of the <i>Art of War</i>, available on the Internet.  The extra material from 
the Project Gutenberg work is included to help give a background and extra
meaning to the book, and a different work was used to convey a smoother
translation of the words that retained the meaning and fire of the original
work.  It is my hope that you enjoy this combined work.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter One:  Laying Plans</h3>

<p>Warfare is a great matter to a nation.  It is the ground of death and of 
life.  It is the road to either safety or destruction.  Therefore, it must
be examined.  The art of war is governed by five constant factors, which
must be considered in order to determine the conditions obtaining in the
field.  They are (1) Way, (2) Heaven, (3) Earth, (4) The Commander, and (5)
Method.</p>

<p>The Way is what causes the people to have the same thinking as their
superiors, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,
undismayed by any danger.<super>*</super>
Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, 
times and seasons.  Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and
security; open ground and narrow passages; the chances of life and death.
The Commander is wisdom, credibility, benevolence, courage, and discipline.
Method is organization, the chain of command, logistics, and the control of
expenses.  These five attributes should be familiar to every general: he who
knows them will be victorious; he who does not shall fail.</p>

<blockquote>* Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying: "Without constant practice, the
officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle; without
constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute when the
crisis is at hand.</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, compare them by means of calculation, and determine their
statuses.  Which ruler has the Way?  Which general has the most ability?
Which has gained Heaven and Ground?  On which side is discipline most
rigorously enforced?<super>*</super>  Which army is stronger, morally and
physically?  What officers and soldiers are trained?<super>**</super>  Which
army rewards and punishes clearly?  By means of these, I know victory and
defeat!</p>

<blockquote>* Tu Mu alludes to the story of Ts`ao Ts`ao, who was such a
strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his own severe
regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned himself to death
for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of corn!  In lieu of losing
his head, he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice by cutting off
his hair.  Ts`ao Ts`ao's comment about the passage was curt:  "when you lay
down a law, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed, the offender
must be put to death."</blockquote>

<blockquote>** Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying:  "Without constant practice,
the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle.
Without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute when
the crisis is at hand.</blockquote>

<p>The general that listens to my counsel and acts upon it will conquer
&ndash; keep him.  A general who does not listen to my councel nor acts upon
it will suffer defeat &ndash; remove him.  While heeding the profit of my
counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond
the ordinary rules.  Force is the control of the balance of power in
accordance with advantages.</p>

<p>All warfare is based on deception.  Hence, when able to attack, we must
seem unable; if active, appear inactive; if near, appear far; if far, appear
near.  If they have the advantage, entice them; if they are confused, take
them; if they are substantial, prepare for them; if he has superior
strength, evade him; if they are angry, disturb them; if they are humble,
make them haughty; if they are relaxed, toil them; and if they are united,
separate them.  Attack where they are not prepared, appear where you are not
expected.  These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged
beforehand.</p>

<p>The general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple
before the battle is fought.  The general who loses a battle makes but few
calculations beforehand.  Many calculations results in victory, few
calculations yields no victory, then how much less so with no calculations?
It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or
lose.</p>

<h3>Chapter Two:  Cost of War</h3>

<p>In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift
chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers,
with provisions enough to carry them a thousand LI<super>*</super>, the
expenditure at home and at the front, including the efforts of having
guests, materials such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and
armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day.  Such is
the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.</p>

<p>When doing battle, seek a quick victory.  A lengthy battle will blunt
weapons and dampen ardor.  If troops lay siege to a walled city, their
strength will be exhausted.  If the campaign is prolonged, the nation's
resources will not suffice.  When weapons are blunted, ardor dampened,
strength exhausted, and resources depleted, the neighboring rulers will
spring up to take advantage of these complications.  Then no man, however
wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.  Therefore, I
have heard of military campaings that were clumsy but swift, but I have
never seen military campaigns that were skilled but prolonged.  No nation
has ever benefited from extended warfare.  It is only one who is thoroughly
acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the
profitable way of carrying it on.</p>

<blockquote>* There are 78 modern LI in a mile (1,000 LI &rarr; about 13
miles), but the length may have varied slightly since Sun Tsu's
time.</blockquote>

<p>Those skilled in doing battle do not raise troops twice, or transport
provisions three times.  Take equipment from home, but take provisions from
the enemy.  Then the army will be sufficient in both equipment and
provisions.  A nation can be impoverished by the army when it has to supply
the army at great distances.  When provisions are transported at a great
distance, the citizens will be impoverished.  Those in proximity to the army
will sell goods at high prices.  When goods are expensive, the citizen's
wealth will be exhausted.  When their wealth is exhausted, the peasantry
will be afflicted with increased taxes.  With this loss of substance and
exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare and
3/10 of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for
broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and
arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy
wagons, will amount to 4/10 of its reserves.</p>

<blockquote>Different versions say the citizens spend 7/10 of their income
and the government will spend 6/10 of its revenue.</blockquote>

<p>Hence, a wise general will strive to forage on the enemy.  One bushel of
the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a
single pound of fodder is worth twenty of our own.<super>*</super>  Killing
the enemy is a matter of arousing anger in our men; taking the enemy's
wealth is a matter of reward.  Therefore, in chariot battles, reward the
first to capture at least ten chariots.  Replace the enemy's flags with our
own.  Mix the captured chariots with our own.  Treat the captured soldiers
will.  This is called using the conquered foe to augment one's own
strength.</p>

<blockquote>* This is because twenty bushels of supplies will be consumed in
the process of transporting one bushel to the front.</blockquote>

<p>In war, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.  Thus,
let it be known that a general who understands warfare is the guardian of
people's lives and the ruler of the nation's security.</p>

<h3>Chapter Three:  Planning Attacks</h3>

<p>Generally in warfare, keeping the enemy's country whole and intact is
better than destroying the nation.  So, too, it is better to capture an
army as a whole than to destroy it; to capture a regiment, detachment, or
company entirely than to destroy them.  Therefore, to fight and conquer in
all your battles is not supreme excellence; to subjugate the enemy's army
without doing battle is the highest mark of excellence.  Thus, the highest
form of generalship is to attack the enemy's plans, next is to attack
alliances, next is to attack the army, and the worst policy is to besiege
walled cities.</p>

<p>Laying siege to a city is only done when other options are not available.
To build large protective shields, armored wagons, and make ready the
necessary arms and equipment will require at least three months.  To build
earthen mounds against the walls will require another three months.  The
general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the
assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are
slain, while the town still remains untaken.  Such are the disastrous
effects of a siege.</p>

<p>Therefore, the skillfull leader subdues the enemy's troops without any
fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he
overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.  His goal
must be to take the entire nation intact.  Therefore, weapons will not be
blunted, and gains will be intact.  These are the principles of planning
attacks.</p>

<p>It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to
surround him; if five to one, immediately attack him, if twice as numerous,
to divide our army into two.<super>*</super>  If equally matched, we can
offer battle;<super>**</super> if weaker, be able to avoid and watch them.
Therfore, a smaller army that is inflexible will be captured by a larger
one.</p>

<blockquote>* Being two to the enemy's one, we may use one part of our army
in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.  One can meet
the enemy in the front, the other from the rear.  If he replies to the
frontal attack, he may be crushed from behind.  If to the rearword attack,
he may be crushed in front.</blockquote>

<blockquote>** If the attackers and attacked are equally matched in
strength, only the able general will fight.</blockquote>

<p>A general is the safeguard of the nation.  When this support is in place,
the nation will certainly be strong.  When this support is not in place, the
nation will certaionly not be strong.</p>

<p>There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:
(1)  By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the
fact that it is in no position to obey.  This is called hobbling the army.
(2)  By attempting to govern an amry in the same way as he administers a
kingdom, being ignorant of the army's condition and matters.  This causes
confusion in the soldier's minds.  (3)  By not being careful to use the
right man in the right place, through ignorance of the military principle of
adaptation to circumstances.  This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
When the army is confused and hesitant, the neighboring rulers will take
advantage.  This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging
victory away.</p>

<p>There are five factors of knowing who will win:  (1)  One who knows when
he can fight and when he cannot fight will be victorious.  (2)  One who
knows how to use both large and small forces will be victorious.  (3)  One
who knows how to unite upper and lower ranks in a singular purpose will be
victorious.  (4)  One who is prepared and waits for the unprepared will be
victorious.  (5)  One whose general is able and is not interfered by the
ruler will be victorious.  These five factors are the way to know who will
win.</p>

<p>Hence the saying:  One who knows the enemy and knows himself need not
fear the result of a hundred battles.  One who does not know the enemy but
knows himself will sometimes win, sometimes lose.  One who does not know the
enemy and does not know himself will be in danger in every battle.</p>

<h3>Chapter Four:  Formation</h3>

<p>In ancient times, those skilled kin warfare make themselves invincible
and then wait for the enemy to become vulderable.  To secure ourselves
against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the
enemy is provided by the enemy himself.  Thus, the good fighter is able to
secure himself against defeat,<super>*</super> but cannot make certain of
defeating the enemy.  Therefore it is said that one may know how to win but
are not able to do it.</p>

<blockquote>* Chang Yu says this is done, "By concealing the disposition of
his troops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting
precautions."</blockquote>

<p>One takes on invincibility defending, one takes on vulnerability
attacking.  Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;
attackin, a superabundance of strength.  The general who is skilled in
defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in
attack falls upon his adversary like a thunderbolt, against which there is
no time to prepare.  On one hand, we have the ability to protect ourselves;
on the other, a victory that is complete.</p>

<p>Perceiving a victory when it is perceived by all is not the pinnacle of
excellence.  Winning battles such that the whole world says "excellent" is
not the greatest excellence.  For lifting an autumn hair<super>*</super> is
no sign of great strengthseeing the sun and moon is not considered a sign of
sharp vision, hearing thunder is not considered a sign of sensitive hearing.
What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but
excels at winning with ease.  Hence, his victories bring him neither
reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.<super>**</super>  He wins his
battles by making no mistakes.  Making no mistakes is what establishes the
certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already
defeated.</p>

<blockquote>* "Autumn hair" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is
finest in autumn.  The phrase is a common one in Chinese writers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>** Tu Mu explains this very well:  Inasmuch as his victories are
gained over circumstances that have not come to light, the world at large
kinows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch as
the hostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed, he receives
no credit for courage.</blockquote>

<p>Those skilled in warfare establish positions that make them invincible
and do not miss opportunities to attack the enemy.  Therefore, a victorious
army first obtains conditions for victory, then seeks to do battle.  One who
is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.  Those
skilled in warfare cultivates the Way and strongly adheres to Method and
discipline; thus it is in his power to govern victory and defeat.</p>

<p>The factors in warfare are measurement, quantity, calculation,
comparison, and finally victory.  Measurements are derived from Earth,
qquantities are derived from measurement, calculations are derived from
quantities, comparisons are derived from calculations, and victories are
derived from comparisons.  A victorious army is like a ton against an ounce;
a defeated army is like an ounce against a ton!  The onrush of a conquering
force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms
deep.</p>

<h3>Chapter Five:  Force</h3>

<p>Commanding a large force is the same as commanding a small force.  It is
a matter of dividing them into groups.  Doing battle with a large army is
like doing battle with a small army.  It is merely a question of instituting
signs and signals.</p>

<p>What enables an army to withstand the enemy's attack and not be defeated
are direct and indirect maneuvers.  That the impact of your army may be like
a boulder hurled at an egg; it is a matter of weakness and strength.
Generally, in battle, use the direct route to engage the enemy and the
indirect route to gain victory.  Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are
inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and
streams.  There are no more than five basic colors*, yet the variations in
the five colors cannot all be seen.  There are no more than five basic
flavors**, yet the variations in the five flavors cannot all be tasted.  In
battle, there are no more than two types of attacks: direct and indirect;
yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.
The direct and the indirect produce each other, like an endless circle.  Who
can exhaust the possibilities of their combinations?</p>

<blockquote>* Blue, yellow, red, white, black.</blockquote>

<blockquote>** Sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter.</blockquote>

<p>The onset of troops is like the rush of torrential waters which will even
roll boulders along its course; this illustrates force.  The quality of
decision is like the well-timed strike of a bird, which enables it to strike
and destroy its victim; this illustrates timing.  Therefore the force of
those skilled in warfare is overwhelming and their timing is precise.  Their
force is like a drawn crossbow; their timing is like the release of the
trigger.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of the turbulence of battle, the fighting seemingly
chaotic and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your
array may appear to be without a head or tail, yet it will be undefeatable.
Simulated disorder requires perfect discipline, simulated fear requires
courage, simulated weakness requires strength.*  Hiding order beneath the
cloak of disorder is simply a matter of organization, concealing courage
under a show of timidity is a matter of force, masking strength with
weakness is a matter of formation.</p>

<blockquote>* Tu Mu puts this quite plainly:  "If you wish to feign confusion
in order to lure the enemy on, you first must have perfect discipline; if
you wish to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have
extreme courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the
enemy over-confident, you must have exceeding strength."</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, those skilled in moving the enemy use formations to which the
enemy must respond.  They offer bait that the enemy must take, manipulating
the enemy to move while they wait in ambush.  The clever combatant uses the
effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals.
Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.
One who exploits this type of force commands men into battle like rolling
logs and buoulders.  Logs and boulders are still when on flat ground, but
roll when on steep ground.  Square shapes are still, but round shapes roll.
Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round
stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height.  So much on the
subject of force.</p>


<h3>Chapter Six:  Weakness and Strength</h3>

<p>Whoever is first in the battlefield and waits for the enemy is at ease;
the one who comes later and rushes into battle is fatigued.  Therefore, the
clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy and are not moved by the
enemy.*  By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to
approach of his own accord; stopping the enemy from approaching is a matter
of showing him harm.</p>

<blockquote>* One mark of a great soldier is that he fights on his own terms
or doesn't fight at all.</blockquote>

<p>If the enemy is at ease, be able to exhaust him; if the enemy is well
fed, be able to starve him; if the enemy is settled, be able to move him.
Appear at places where he must rush to defend, and rush to places where he
least expects.  An army can march great distances without becoming
distressed where the enemy is not present.  You can be certain of success in
your attacks if you only attack weak points.  You can be certain of the
safety of your defense if you only hold positions that contain no weak
points.*  Therefore, against those skilled in attack, the enemy does not
know where to defend; against those skilled in defense, the enemy does not
know where to attack.  O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!  Through you we
learn to be without form or sound; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in
our hands.</p>

<blockquote>* Chang Yu expand on this:  "He who is skilled in attack flashes
forth from the topmost heights of Heaven, making it impossible for the
enemy to guard against him.  This being so, the places that I shall attack
are precisely those that the enemy cannot defend.  He who is skilled in
defense hides in the most secret recesses of the Earth, making it impossible
for the enemy to estimate his whereabouts.  This being so, the places that I
shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack."</blockquote>

<p>To achieve an advance that cannot be hampered, rush to his weak points.
To achieve a withdrawl that cannot be pursued, depart with superior speed.
If we want to do battle, even if the enemy is sheltered behind high walls
and deep moats, he is unable to not do battle.  We attack what he must
rescue.*  If we do not want to do battle, even if we merely draw a line on
the ground, he will not do battle.  All we need to do is throw something odd
and unaccountable in his way.**</p>

<blockquote>* Tun My says:  "If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut
his line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to
return; if we are the invaders, we may direct are attack against the
soverign himself."</blockquote>

<blockquote>** Tu Mu clinches this meaning with an illustrative anecdote of
Chu-ko Liang.  When he was occupying Yang-p`ing and was about to be attacked
by Ssu-ma I, he suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the
drums, and flung open the city gates.  Inside appeared only a few men
engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground.  This unexpected proceeding
had the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew
off his army and retreated.  What Sun Tsu is advocating here, therefore, is
nothing more nor less than the timely use of <i>bluff</i>.</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, if we can make the enemy show his position while remaining
invisible ourselves, we will be at full force when the enemy is divided to
protect against attack from every quarter.  We can form a single united
body, while the enemy must split up into fractions and we will attack him at
ten times his strength.  Hence, there will be a whole pitted against
separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's
few.  If we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one,
our opponents will be in dire straits.</p>

<p>The place of battle must not be made known to the enemy.  If it is not
known, then the enemy must prepare to defend many places.  If he prepares to
defend many places, then the forces will be few in number.  Therefore, if he
prepares to defend the front, the back will be weak.  If he prepares to
defend the back, the front will be weak.  If he strengthens his left, the
right will be weak.  If he strengthens his right, the left will be weak.  If
he prepares to defend everywhere, everywhere will be weak.*  Numerical
weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical
strength comes from compelling our adversary to make these preparations
against us.</p>

<blockquote>* In Frederick the Great's <i>Instructions To His Generals</i>
we read: "A defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment.
Those generals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every
point, while those who are better acquainted with their profession, having
only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow, and
acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater."</blockquote>

<p>Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate
from the greatest distances in order to fight.  If one does not know the
place of battle and the day of battle, then his left cannot aid his right
and his right cannot aid his left; his front unable to relieve the rear and
the rear unable to support the front.  How much more so if the furthest
portions of the army are separated by tens of miles or hundreds of miles.
Based on my calculations, though the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in
number, that has no advantage in respect to victory.  Therefore I say
victory can be achieved.</p>

<p>Though the enemy is stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from
fighting.  Know the enemy's plans and calculate their strengths and
weaknesses.  Provoke him and to learn his patterns of movement.  Determine
his position in order to find out his vulnerable spots.  Carefully compare
the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is
superabundant and where it is deficient.</p>

<p>The ultimate skill is to take up a position where you show no sign of
what you mean to do.  If you are able to hide your intentions, you will be
safe from the most penetrating spies and from the calculations of the wisest
counsels.  With formation, the army achieves victories out of the enemy's
own tactics, yet they do not understand how.  Everyone knows the formation
by which you achieved victory, yet no one knows the formations by which you
were able to create victory.  Do not repeat the tactics which have gained
you one fictory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety
of circumstances.</p>

<p>Military tactics are like water.  The water's formation avoids the high
and rushes to the low.  So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to
strike at what is weak.  Water's formation adapts to the ground when
flowing.  So then an army's formation adapts to the enemy to achieve
victory.  Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare
there are no constant conditions.  Those who are able to adapt and change in
accord with the enemy and achieve victory are called divine.  Therefore, of
the five elements, none has a constant victor, of the four seasons, none has
constant position; the sun has short and long spans, and the moon waxes and
wanes.</p>


<h3>Chapter Seven:  Armed Struggle</h3>

<p>In war, the general receives his commands from the ruler, collects his
army, and must establish harmony and confidence between higher and lower
ranks before venturing into the field.  Tactical maneuvering comes after
that, and nothing is more difficult.  The challenge is turing the devius
into the direct and misfortune into advantage.  Therefore, if you make the
enemy's route circuitous and bait him with advantages, though you start
behind him, you will arrive before him.  This shows knowledge of the
artifice of deviation.</p>

<p>Maneuvering with an army is advantageous, but is most dangerous with 
an undisciplined multitude.  If you set a fully equipped army to march in
order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late.  If
a reduced army is sent, your stores and equipment will be lost.  Thus, if
you roll up your armor and make forced marches without halting day or night,
covering double the usual distance for an advantage a hundred miles, the
leaders of your divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.  The
stronger men will arrive first, the weak ones will fall behind, and only
one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.*  If one struggles for a 
distance that is fifty miles away, the leader of your front forces will be
lost and only one-half will arrive.  If one struggles for an advantage
thirty miles away, two-thirds of your army will arrive.  For this reason, if
an army is without its equipment, it will lose; if an army is without its
provisions, it will lose; if the army is without its stores, it will lose.</p>

<blockquote>* The moral is:  Don't march a hundred miles to gain a tactical
advantage, either with or without impedimenta.  Maneuvers of this type
should be confied to short distances.  The hardships of forced marches are
often more painful than the dangers of battle.  Only when great surprise or
a rapid retreat is imperative, one should sacrifice everything for
speed.</blockquote>

<p>One who does not know the intentions of the rulers of the neighboring
states cannot secure alliances.  One who does not know the mountains and
forests, mountains and valleys, swamps and wetlands cannot advance the
army.  One who does not use local guides cannot take advantage of the
ground.</p>

<p>The army that practices deception will succeed.  Curcumstances must
dictate whether to concentrate or to divide your troops.  Your army will
advance rapidly and without tracks like the wind, march with density* 
like the forest, invades and plunders like a blazing fire, is as immovable
like the mountain, is formless like the dark, strikes like lightning and
thunder.  When you plunder the countryside, divide the wealth among your
troops.  When you expand your territory, divide up and hold places of
advantage.  Calculate the situation before you make a move.  Those who know
the art of deception will be victorious.  Such is the art of maneuvering.

<blockquote>* While a forest doesn't have order and ranks, which must be
preserved, it does have the quality of density or compactness.  This guards
against surprise attacks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This next appendix is an extract from an earlier book on War,
now lost.  Sun Tzu thought it important enough to include.</blockquote>

<p>From the Book on Army Management:  The spoken word does not carry in
battle, thus drums and gongs are used.  Troops cannot see each other
clearly, thus flags and pennants are used.  These tools unite the army into
a single united body where the brave cannot advance alone and the cowardly
cannot retreat alone.  This is the art of handling large masses of men.  In
night battles, use many torches and drums.  In day battles, use many flags
and pennants in order to influence men's eyes and ears.</p>

<p>A whole army may be robbed of its spirit, a general can be robbed of his
presence of mind.  A soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday,
it has begun to wane; and in the evening, his mind is only set on returning
to camp.  A clever general avoids an army when its energy is up, but attacks
when it is sluggish and inclined to return.  This is the art of studying
moods.</p>

<p>Await the appearance of disorder and clamoramong the enemy while
remaining disciplined and calm yourself.  This is the way to manage the
mind.  Be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, then rest
while the enemy is toiling and struggling; be well fed when the enemy is
famished.  This is the art of managing strength.  Refrain from intercepting
an enemy whose banners are in perfect order; do not not battle with
well-regulated formations.  This is the art of studying circumstances.  The
principles of warfare are to not attack an enemy that has the high ground,
do not attack an enemy that has his back to a hill, do not persue feigned
retreats, do not attack elite troops, do not swallow the enemy's bait, do
not thwart an enemy retreating home*.  If you surround the enemy, leave a
path of retreat**.  Do not press an enemy that is cornered or a foe that is
desperate.  Such is the art of warfare.</p>

<blockquote>*  A man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to the
death against any attempt ot bar his way and is therefore too dangerous an
opponent to be tackled.  Han Hsin said, "Invincible is the soldier who hath
his desire and returneth homewards."</blockquote>

<blockquote>** This does not mean that the enemy is allowed to escape.  The
object is to make him believe that there is a road to safety, and thus
prevent his fighting with the courage of despair.  After that, you may crush
him.</blockquote>


<h3>Chapter Eight:  Variation In Tactics</h3>

<p>In war, the general receives his commands from the ruler, assembles the
armies, and mobilizes the masses.  Do not camp on difficult ground.  Unite
with your allies on intersecting ground.  Do not stay on open ground.  Be
prepared on surrounded ground.  Do battle on deadly ground.  There are roads
which must not be followed, armies which must not be attacked, towns which
must not be besieged, grounds which must not be contested, commands which
must not be obeyed.</p>

<p>The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that varying
tactics knows how to handle his troops.  The general who does not understand
these, even if he knows the lay of the land, will not be able to use his
knowledge to get the advantage of the ground.  Those who command an army but
does not understand variations in tactics, even if he is familiar with a
basic understanding of warfare, will not be able to best use his troops.</p>

<p>Therefore, the wise general contemplates both the advantages and
disadvantages.  If our expectation of advantage is tempered in this way, we
may succeed in accomplishing the critical part of our schemes.  If we are
always ready to sieze an advantage in the midst of difficulties, we may
extricate ourselves from misfortune.  Get the enemy into a position where he
must suffer injury, and he will submit of his own accord.  Make trouble for
the neighboring rulers with constant matters, and prevent them from having
any rest.  Hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given
point.</p>

<p>The art of war teaches us to not rely on the likelihood of the enemy's
not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of
his not attacking, but rather on the fact htat we have made our position
unassailable.  There are five dangerous traits of a general:  Recklessness,
which leads to destruction; cowardice, which leads to capture; tempermental,
which can be provoked by insults; a delicacy of honor, which is sensitive to
shame; being too fond of his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.
These five traits are faults in a general and are disastrous in warfare.
The army's destruction and the death of the general are due to these five
dangerous traits.  Let them be a subject of meditation.</p>


<h3>Chapter Nine:  Army Maneuvers</h3>

<p>One must consider how to position the army and observe the signs of the
enemy.  Pass quickly over mountains and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.
Camp in high places, facing the sun.  If the enemy holds the high ground, do
not ascend and do battle with him.  So much for mountain warfare.</p>

<p>After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.  If the enemy
crosses a river, do not meet him in the water.  It will be best to let half
the army get across, and then deliver your attack.  If you are anxious to
fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to
cross.  Moor your craft higher up than the enemy and facing the sun.  Do 
not move upstream to meet the enemy.  So much for river warfare.</p>

<p>After crossing swamps and wetlands, stive to quickly get through them; do
not linger.  If you do battle in swamps and wetlands, you must position
close to grass, with the trees to your back.  So much for marshland
warfare.</p>

<p>In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with your
right backed by high ground, the dangerous ground in front, and safe ground
to the back so that the danger may be in front and safety lie behind.  So 
much for grassland warfare.  These are the four positions advantageous to
the army, which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four soverigns.</p>

<p>All armies prefer high ground to low, and sunny places to dark.  If you
are careful of your men and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from
disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.  When there are hills
and embankments, occupy the sunny side with the slope on your right rear.
Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the
natural advantages of the ground.</p>

<p>When the rainwater up-country swells a river which you wish to ford, wait
until it settles.  Where there is ground with precipitous cliffs, impassable
ravines, natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires, and
crevasses, it should be left with all possible speed and not approached.
While we avoid such places, we should get the enemy to approach them.  When
we face the enemy, he will have such places at his back.  When the army is
flanked by high ground, wetlands, tall reeds and grass, mountain forests, or
areas thick with undergrowth, they must be carefully examined and searched
because these are places where men lie in ambush or where spies hide.</p>

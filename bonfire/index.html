	    The bonfire was rescheduled due to rain and to let more people attend.
	    Even though it didn't really rain, the record highs coupled with the
	    humidity would have made having a big fire really silly.<br>

Rescheduled to November 10-11.
<br><br>
Updated the party page for 2007.</p>

<p>New!!  I added my comment script to the bottom of this page.  Enjoy.</p>

<p>Fire lighting will be with my block of magnesium this time or with a fire
piston if I can get one ready before that date.  Why be boring?</p>

<p>Target practice is moved also, but not sure if it will be Saturday or
Sunday.  I know that there will be the
following guns available for people to try out.  Bring ammo to share and
don't feel afraid to ask (even though we all look scary).<br>
Rifles: .22<br>
Shotguns:  12 ga<br>
Handguns: .50 (most likely), .45, .44, .40, .38, 9mm, others?

<font size="+2"><a class=notlink name="background">What is this thing?</a></font>

<p>Pick your favorite:</p>

<ul>

<li>It is just a get-together of friends that happens every year.
A great excuse to see each other and swap stories.</li>
<li>We hate trees and devote our lives to making them burn.</li>
<li>Where else are you <i>encouraged</i> to play with fire?</li>
<li>Party all night!</li>

</ul>

<p>Besides, what better thing do you have to do that weekend?</p>

<p>There's a rumor that it is for someone's birthday party, but there's no
October birthdays of which I am aware.</p>

<p>Need to know more?  I have a category in my <a
href="http://rumkin.com/photos/index.php?gid=31">photo album</a> devoted to
this thing, and there's even a video of Jeff blowing <a
href="media/bursts.avi">short shots of fire</a> (avi format).

<table width=90% align=center class=glassy><tr><td>

<font size="+2"><a class=notlink name="provided">What is Provided?</a></font>

<p>We will provide the usual items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many hot dogs (both the no-skin type and the old
fashioned skin-on style) with enough buns</li>
<li>At least 1 big package of big marshmallows</li>
<li>Some pop (likely a couple 2-liter bottles of Coke, Mountain Dew, etc.)</li>
<li>Grenadine (for making Cherry Coke, Kiddie Cocktails, &Uuml;lli's "grenadine
and a splash of pop" drink, etc.)</li>
<li>Chips (not potato chips, but unknown type and quantity)</li>
<li>Ketchup, Mustard, Relish (Dill if possible)</li>
<li>Fire-friendly paper cups (For the "Who's is this?" "Dunno" "Toss it in
the fire" type of conversation)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, I will likely be bringing a bottle of rum for mixing rum
&amp; Cokes.  If you have some bottles of booze gathering dust in your
cupboard, just bring it and we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>Breakfast this year will be eggs, bacon, toast, milk, etc.  Be hungry.
The last couple years, not enough breakfast was served.  In fact, nobody was
flopping on the floor, begging that we "just end it all" because they ate
too much.  We must change that this year. (2 doz eggs or more, 4lbs
bacon or more, 2 loaves bread, <b>can you eat it all?</b>)</p>

<font size="+2"><a class=notlink name="bring">What should you bring?</a></font>

<p>If you are rich, large donations (eg. $1,250.75) are accepted, but only
if you were just going to buy a small country, fund a politician, or 
otherwise waste the money.  If you have a special
desire to eat turkey hotdogs or have muffins for breakfast, feel free to
bring them.  However, this isn't like a potluck dinner -- you aren't
required to bring food/drinks unless you really don't like what is being
served.  If that is the case, just call me before hand and maybe I can 
change the menu.  Regarding alcohol, bring whatever you want and it is
sometimes nice to share.  Lots-o-fun!</p>

<p>For staying the night, you may wish to bring pillows, blankets, a towel
(shower is <i>definately</i> available).  Unfortunately, the only place to
sleep is on the floor in my parent's house or outside.  Fortunately, they
just got new carpeting in 2002, so it should still be fluffy (or stiff 
from the starch).  If you have a tent,
sleeping bags, or you just like to freeze to death under the stars, that 
works for me.  If you have a tent to set up, come earlier because the light
from that big ball of fire in the sky will assist you.  Heck, I have tents,
cots, and sleeping bags to share, if someone wants to go that route.  Just
let me know in advance!</p>

<h1 align=center>Directions</h1>

<h2>From the cities</h2>

<p><b>Quick and Dirty:</b> West on 7, north on 25, drive for about 2 miles.  
It is the brown mailbox on the right, number 3555.</p>

<p><b>A bit more detail:</b> Once you get on Hwy 25 north, drive for about 2
miles.  After about 1 or 1 1/2 miles, you'll take a wide turn to the right, 
followed by a little straight section, then a wide turn to the left.  
At the end of the left turn, you will be cresting over a hill and there will
be a house or two on the left.  Immediately after them is a field on your
left.  Slow down!  On your right will be a little hidden driveway with a
mailbox with 3555 on it.  Turn in there.

<p>Highway 7 is highlighted in green from the cities.</p>

<h2>From the north (northern cities, northern Minnesota, North Dakota, etc.)</h2>

<p>First, get to Watertown.  Your trip may vary, depeinding on how you want
to arrive.  You could take 94 to Hwy. 25, and take Hwy 25 south to
Watertown.  You could take Hwy 12 to county road 6.  Either way, you want to
get to Watertown and take Highway 25 south out of town.
Cross the cement bridge after about 2 miles, and it will be the first
mailbox on your left.</p>

<h2>From Mankato</h2>

<p><b>Easy directions:</b>  Take 169 north until you get to Hwy 41 (near
Chaska/Shakopee).  Head north on it (the only direction).  Drive until you
hit Highway 7 (where Hwy 41 ends) and take a left.  Drive west on Hwy 7 and
follow the instructions for people coming from the cities.</p>

<p>Those directions are not the fastest way, but they are the best route if
you don't know your way and you are driving at night or if there is snow on
the roads.</p>

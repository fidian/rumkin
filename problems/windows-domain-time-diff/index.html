<p>While working on a Windows Domain, there were some computers that didn&#39;t behave well. In particular, they didn&#39;t keep their time correctly. When I attempted to log in with my domain credentials, a message would show up and I would not be allowed access. This particular problem makes it very hard to log into a computer and fix the problem.</p><h2 id=symptoms>Symptoms</h2><p>When logging into a computer that is on a domain, or if you try to access a computer that is on a domain, you get one of the following error messages:</p><pre><code>There is a time difference between the client and server.
</code></pre><h2 id=causes>Causes</h2><p>The clock on the machine that you are trying to log into is reporting a different time from what the domain controller has.</p><h2 id=solution>Solution</h2><p>You need to synchronize your clocks. For the following examples, replace <code>%DOMAIN%</code> with your domain name and <code>%WORKSTATION%</code> with the name of any computer on the domain. <code>%USERNAME%</code> refers to your network logon user id.</p><ul><li>Log in as a local administrator. If you don&#39;t have access to a local administrator account, you can try the following:<ul><li>Unplug the network cable and try to login as you normally would. The client likely has your credentials cached.</li><li>You can download the <a href=http://home.eunet.no/pnordahl/ntpasswd/ >Offline NT Password &amp; Registry Editor</a> floppy or CD image and use it to blank the admin password.</li></ul></li><li>Obtain a command shell with one of these methods:<ul><li>Start -&gt; Run -&gt; <code>command</code></li><li>Start -&gt; Run -&gt; <code>cmd</code></li></ul></li><li>Sync the time with this command: <code>net time /domain:%DOMAIN% /set</code><ul><li>If that does not work, open a remote computer by <code>start \\%WORKSTATION%</code></li><li>Log in with the username <code>%DOMAIN%\%USERNAME%</code> and your domain password.</li><li>Go back to the command prompt and type in <code>net time \\%WORKSTATION% /set</code></li></ul></li><li>Type in <code>exit</code> to leave the command shell.</li><li>At this point, your time will be synchronized with the domain. Log out and try to log into the domain normally again.</li></ul><p>Problem solved.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=232386">Microsoft Knowledge Base</a> - article that uses <code>net time</code> to fix the problem.</li><li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=297234">Microsoft Help and Support</a> - page that illustrates how to use regedit to fix a very similar problem.</li></ul>

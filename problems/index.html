<p>Ever have a weird problem that you couldn&#39;t figure out how to get rid of it? I have. Sometimes the information isn&#39;t even on the web when I search for the answer, or else the answer is split up and scattered across numerous web pages. Because of that, I have collected my goofy problems here on this page in the hopes that it will save another person some time.</p><ul><li><p><a href=7-inch-laptop/ >7 Inch Laptop</a> - Installing Linux and overcoming hardware issues with a cheap and small laptop.</p></li><li><p><a href=averatec-6200/ >Linux on Averatec 6200</a> - Notes about getting this laptop to boot Linux and resolve some of the hardware issues.</p></li><li><p><a href=aws-maximum-number-of-interfaces/ >AWS Maximum Number of Interfaces Exceecded</a> - Had difficulty making a new instance when we didn&#x27;t hit our instance limit.

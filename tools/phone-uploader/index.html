<p>This project allowed people to upload files to older cell phones, ones that are not Android, iPhone nor any other kind of &quot;smart&quot; cell phone. These phones didn&#39;t even have USB nor a wireless connection, so people had a heck of a time getting custom backgrounds.</p><p>The software was taken offline for many reasons. Lack of funding, lack of users, lack of interest, and a whole bunch of potential exposure to new risks that my insurance company didn&#39;t like.</p><p>Do you want to host this uploader yourself? That&#39;s great! I&#39;m releasing the source code and you&#39;re welcome to get it running.</p><ul><li><a href=midlets.zip>midlets</a> - Simplified version that lets people host midlets (jar files) and download them to their phone. Does not require a database, but it also needs you to manually modify a file in order to see it listed and allow it to be downloaded. Requires PHP on the server. <code>debug.php</code> can test if things are mostly working correctly. <code>index.php</code> is what needs to get modified to start hosting your own files. Comes with <code>mgmaps</code> for two platforms and another program so you can see how this set of files work.</li><li><a href=20150710.zip>2015-07-10</a> - Snapshot of the files right before I took the site down. The database was removed and now the filesystem is used again, but in a much better way.</li><li><a href=20051019.zip>2005-10-19</a> - Earlier snapshot. Refined the database and the code.</li><li><a href=20040203.zip>2004-02-03</a> - Even earlier. Added a database.</li><li><a href=older.zip>Super Old</a> - This one is so old that it didn&#39;t even use a database to store the files.</li></ul>

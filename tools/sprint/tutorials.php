<p>I greatly appreciate the work that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JarrodJS">JarrodJS</a> has put into making some videos on how to use this site.</p>

<?PHP

Section('Wallpapers');
YouTube('Mo6TOw0EqK4', array('float' => 'right')); // wallpapers

?>

<ol>
<li>Find a picture and save it on your computer.
<li>Resize it to fit your phone's screen.  The uploader will do this automatically for you on some phones.
<li>Upload it to the uploader.
<li>Use your phone's browser to go to the jump page.
<li>Enter the jump code.
<li>Download to your phone.  If things work out well, you should now be able to set it as a wallpaper somehow.
</ol>

<?PHP

Section('Applications');
YouTube('tj6Ejg2ZHLo', array('float' => 'right'));  // app

?>

<ol>
<li>Find an application for your phone and save it on your computer.
<li>Upload it to the uploader.
<li>Use your phone's browser to go to the jump page.
<li>Enter the jump code.
<li>Download the program to your phone.
<li>Test the program.  It might not work for your phone, so don't get too upset if there are problems.
</ol>

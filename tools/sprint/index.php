<p>I'm sorry to say this, but it is time for the uploader to come to an end. I have decided it was time to end this project because there were no donations for well over a year, yet it still handled 35,479 uploads for the visitors.</p>

<p>The uploader was running for well over 10 years. In that time, 29 wonderful people donated a total of $127.17 (after PayPal's fees) and I received about double that from ads. I am immensely grateful for each donation that was received. It isn't enough to pay for the insurance to cover me when illegal content gets uploaded and people could view it from my site.</p>

<p>The good news is that the software is still free and available for others to host on their own PHP server.</p>

<li><a href="20150710.zip">2015-07-10</a> - Snapshot of the files right before I took the site down. The database was removed and now the filesystem is used again, but in a much better way. The files haven't changed even though the site was operating well into 2017.</li>
<li><a href="20051019.zip">2005-10-19</a> - Earlier snapshot. Refined the database and the code.</li>
<li><a href="older.zip">Super Old</a> - This one is so old that it didn't even use a database to store files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Junk email (a.k.a. spam) is a part of everyone&#39;s life if they ever put their email address on the web. For HTML authors, site admins, and for people who want a little credit on the page that they put online, it is a constant problem. You want to include your email address on the page, but you don&#39;t want your email address to be harvested by spambots.</p><p>The best thing you can do is encode your email address so that browsers can see it and spambots can not. This is what this tool attempts to do. I have created two different versions of the address encoder. Please pick the one that is appropriate:</p><h2 id=simple-email-encoder>Simple Email Encoder</h2><div class=moduleSimple></div><h2 id=custom-email-encoder>Custom Email Encoder</h2><p>Did you need a bit more control? This one is far fancier, but that means it is also more complex and could generate something invalid. Make sure to test the generated code.</p><p>Not all fields work well with all combinations of browsers and email clients. It is best if you only use the &quot;To&quot; field, but the others are available.</p><div class=moduleCustom></div><h2 id=about-the-encoder>About The Encoder</h2><p>These tools do not steal your email addresses. Nothing is sent back to my server, and everything runs in JavaScript in your browser. If you don&#39;t believe me, check out this <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,7309390~root=spam~mode=flat">independent review</a> of a mirror the tools provided here.</p><p>Keep in mind that this is not the end-all. There are other solutions out there, such as:</p><ul><li>Java applet that shows the address and lets you click on it, but will foil spambots because they don&#39;t have a Java interpreter.</li><li>CGI scripts to send you mail directly without ever giving your address out. Make sure you don&#39;t specify the target email address in the feedback form itself!</li><li>A form button that will pop up a JavaScript window.</li><li>Generic JavaScript that will decode your address and forward you to the proper <code>mailto:</code> link.</li><li>A public guestbook or forum.</li></ul><p>Remember that creativity is the key when playing against spammers. They eventually adapt their techniques in order to make another $.05. That&#39;s why there is no single solution. If there is ever a single awesome way of doing this, then spammers will adapt their programs and we&#39;ll all need to find another method. So, if you like something you see, you may want to alter it just a bit so that spammers have a harder time reaping your email address.</p><p>If there is much demand, this program can be further enhanced to do the following neat ideas:</p><ul><li>Work with imagemaps and links better (you can use it now with imagemaps -- see <a href=imagemaps/ >these instructions</a>.</li><li>Make the JavaScript put up a link that, when clicked, will pop open a window and automatically roll-over to the right email address. This doesn&#39;t appear to have more security than the JavaScript code already in place.</li><li>Generate the code necessary for a form button that will take appropriate action when clicked. This also doesn&#39;t appear to be better and browsers can have difficulty showing or submitting the form.</li><li>Generate code for a Java applet or Flash to display your email address, but Java and Flash are on the way out.</li><li>Use some server-side software (like this <a href=example-php.txt>PHP code</a>) to make any email addresses on your site encrypted.</li></ul><h2 id=links>Links</h2><ul><li><a href=http://www.pascalirma.org/masquage_email.php>French version</a> - Thanks to Pascal for translating a previous version of this email address encoder!</li><li><a href=http://www.metaprog.com/samples/encoder.htm>Email Encoder</a> - A lot more on using links to call JavaScript functions that take your browser to the email link.</li><li><a href=http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum91/492.htm>Experiences with using JavaScript ...</a> - Lots of great information.

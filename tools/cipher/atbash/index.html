<p>The Atbash cipher is a very common and simple cipher that simply encodes a message with the reverse of the alphabet. Initially it was used with Hebrew. Basically, when encoded, an &quot;A&quot; becomes a &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;B&quot; turns into &quot;Y&quot;, etc.</p><p>The Atbash cipher can be implemented as an <a href=../affine/ >Affine cipher</a> by setting both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to 25 (the alphabet length minus 1).</p><div class=module></div>

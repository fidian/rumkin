<p>Let&#39;s say that you need to send your friend a message, but you don&#39;t want another person to know what it is. You can use a full-blown encryption tool, such as PGP. If the message isn&#39;t that important or if it is intended to be decrypted by hand, you should use a simpler tool. This is a page dedicated to simple text manipulation tools, which all can be replicated with just paper and pencil.</p><p>If you know of another cipher that you think should be on here or a tool that would be useful, request it and perhaps it can be added to the site.</p><h2 id=ciphers>Ciphers</h2><ul><li><a href=affine/ >Affine</a> - Similar to a Caesarian shift, but also adds in a multiplier to further scramble letters.</li><li><a href=atbash/ >Atbash</a> - A very simplistic cipher where you change A to Z, B to Y, and so on.</li><li><a href=baconian/ >Baconian</a> - Used to hide a message within another message by using different typefaces or other distinguishing characteristics.</li><li><a href=base64/ >Base64</a> - This is typically used to make binary data safe to transport as strictly text.</li><li><a href=bifid/ >Bifid</a> - Breaks information for each letter up and spreads it out in the encoded message. An easy and fairly secure pencil &amp; paper cipher.</li><li><a href=caesar/ >Caesar</a> - A Caesar cipher lets you add an arbitrary value, shifting each letter forwards or backwards. Traditionally, the offset is 3, making A into D, B into E, etc.</li><li><a href=columnar-transposition/ >Columnar Transposition</a> - Write a message as a long column and then swap around the columns. Read the message going down the columns. A simple cypher, but one that is featured on the Kryptos sculpture at the CIA headquarters.</li><li><a href=double-columnar-transposition/ >Double Columnar Transposition</a> - Because two is better than one. This was used by the U.S. Army during World War II.</li><li><a href=gronsfeld/ >Gronsfeld</a> - This operates very similar to a Vigenère cipher, but uses numbers instead of a key word.</li><li><a href=letter-numbers/ >Letter Numbers</a> - Replace each letter with the number of its position in the alphabet. A simple replacment method that is usually the first one taught to children and is still an effective way to obscure your message.</li><li><a href=morse-code/ >Morse Code</a> - Once used to transmit messages around the world, this system can still be used in certain situations to send messages effectively when alternate mediums are not available.</li><li><a href=one-time-pad/ >One Time Pad</a> - A virtually uncrackable cipher that relies heavily upon a random source for an encryption key.</li><li><a href=playfair/ >Playfair</a> - This cipher uses pairs of letters and a 5x5 grid to encode a message. It is fairly strong for a pencil and paper style code.</li><li><a href=railfence/ >Railfence</a> - A mildly complicated one where you align letters on different rows and then squish the letters together in order to create your ciphertext.</li><li><a href=rot13/ >ROT13</a> - A popular method of hiding text so that only people who actually take the time to decode it can actually read it. You swap letters; A becomes N, and N becomes A. It was quite popular on bulletin board systems and Usenet newsgroups. You can do it with the cryptogram solver also, if you make A&#x3D;N, B&#x3D;O, C&#x3D;P, etc.</li><li><a href=rotate/ >Rotate</a> - This acts as though you are writing the letters in a rectangular grid and then rotating the grid to the left or right 90°</li><li><a href=skip/ >Skip</a> - To decode this, you count N characters, write down the letter, count forward N characters, write down the letter, etc. It is used for section 3 of the Kryptos.</li><li><a href=substitution/ >Substitution</a> - Substitute your plaintext letters with other letters, images, or codes. Includes two common pigpen ciphers and the Sherlock Holmes&#x27; Dancing Men cipher.</li><li><a href=ubchi/ >Übchi</a> - A double columnar transposition cipher that uses the same key, but adds a number of pad characters. Used by the Germans in World War I.</li><li><a href=vigenere/ >Vigenère</a> - Based somewhat on the Caesarian shift cipher, this changes the shift amount with each letter in the message and those shifts are based on a passphrase. A pretty strong cipher for beginners, and one that can be done on paper easily.</li></ul><h2 id=tools>Tools</h2><ul><li><a href=cryptogram-solver/ >Cryptogram Solver</a> - If you have a plain text message, this will help find possible solutions in a matter of seconds. It works with simple substitution ciphers in plain English only.</li><li><a href=cryptogram/ >Cryptogram</a> - This helps you manually solve simple ciphers, which are methods where you replace one letter with another.</li><li><a href=letter-frequency-analysis/ >Letter Frequency Analysis</a> - Shows how often certain letters appear in your text. Used primarily to assist in decryption.</li><li><a href=text-manipulator/ >Text Manipulator</a> - Change text around, make things upper- or lowercase,count/remove spaces. Also does various statistical analyses on the source text.</li></ul>

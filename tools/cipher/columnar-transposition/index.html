<p>A columnar transposition, also known as a row-column transpose, is a very simple cipher to perform by hand. First, you write your message in columns. Then, you just rearrange the columns. For example. I have the message, &quot;Which wristwatches are swiss wristwatches.&quot; You convert everything to upper case and write it without spaces. When you write it down, make sure to put it into columns and number them. Let&#39;s use five columns.</p><table align=center border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><th>Unencoded</th><th>Rearranged</th></tr><tr><td valign=top><b>Column #:</b></td><td><tt><b><u>4 2 5 3 1</u></b><br>W H I C H<br>W R I S T<br>W A T C H<br>E S A R E<br>S W I S S<br>W R I S T<br>W A T C H<br>E S</tt></td><td><tt><b><u>1 2 3 4 5</u></b><br>H H C W I<br>T R S W I<br>H A C W T<br>E S R E A<br>S W S S I<br>T R S W I<br>H A C W T<br>&nbsp; S &nbsp; E</tt></td></tr></table><p>Now, you just read the columns down in the order that you number them. Above, you will see the key is 4 2 5 3 1, which means you write down the last column first, then the second, then the fourth, the first, and finally the middle. When you are all done, you will get &quot;HTHESTHHRASWRASCSCRSSCWWWESWWEIITAIIT&quot;.</p><p>Spacing is preserved with this implementation, so I would suggest you remove spaces so people don&#39;t know word length in your message.</p><p>The column key can be a list of numbers or an alphabetic keyword/keyphrase.</p><div class=module></div>

<p>If you find that the <a href="ballistic_gel.php">official stuff</a> is a
bit spendy, or if you only want a couple blocks of gel, you can make your
own from <a href="alt_gelatin.php">store-purchased gelatin</a>.</p>

<p>If you just want to shoot stuff, pick from the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jugs of water
<li><a href="#wet_newspaper">Wet newspaper</a>
<li>Slime (made with <a href="#slime_guar">guar gum</a> or <a
href="#slime_glue">glue</a>)
</ul>

<?php Section('Wet Newspaper', 'wet_newspaper'); ?>

<p>Get some large wastebaskets to hold the water and newspaper.  Two in a
row will work for pistols, three should stop rifles.  When you save up
newspaper, stack it by alternating the major fold so that it lies square.
Take out all inserts, glossy paper, and non-newsprint.</p>

<p>Stack the dry paper on edge in the wastebasket.  Try to get the edges as
square as possible for consistency.  Center the paper in the basket and
leave space around all sides for expansion.  Fill the wastebasket with
water.  Keep it filled to the brim and let it soak for at least 2 hours.  As
the paper fills with water, the level may drop.  Keep it filled.</p>

<p>To transport, pour out excess water and put the containers in plastic bags.
Do not remove the paper from the wastebaskets until you are ready to fire.
Stack the "bales" of paper on edge and shoot into the flat surface of the
bale. You can make about five good shots to get accurate data before the paper
disintegrates too much.

<?php Section('Guar Gum Slime', 'slime_guar'); ?>

<p>Stir together 48 parts warm water for 1 part borax (1 cup of warm water and 
1 tsp. borax).  Set aside.

<p>Stir together 48 parts cold water and .25 parts guar gum
(1 cup of cold water and &frac14; tsp. guar gum).  While
stirring constantly, heat the mixture until it boils.  Remove from heat and
stir in two parts (2 tsp.) of the borax mixture.  Continue to stir until the
slime form.  Do not play with it until it is cool enough to handle 
comfortably.</p>

<p>Store in an airtight container.  If my math is correct, 1 lb of guar 
gum (6 tsp per oz) will make about 24 gallons, which is about 3 cubic feet.
(.45 kilograms becomes 90.85 liters, which is 90 850 cubic centimeters)</p>

<?php Section('Glue Slime', 'slime_glue'); ?>

<p>Pour &frac12; cup of water (3 parts water) into a small bowl.  
Add 6 Tbsp borax (1 part borax) and stir until dissolved.  Set aside.</p>

<p>Pour &frac12; cup of water (3 parts water) into a medium-sized glass 
or metal bowl.  Add &frac12; cup (3 parts blue &ndash; a 4 oz bottle) of 
white school glue.  Stir until combined.
Optionally add a few drops of food coloring to change the color.

<p>Pour the borax mixture into the glue mixture.  Knead with hands until
most of the water is absorbed and you can form a ball of slime in your
hands.  Lift the slime from the bowl and discard any water mixture remaining
in the bowl.  Return the slime to the bowl and allow it to sit uncovered for
15-20 minutes or until fairly firm.

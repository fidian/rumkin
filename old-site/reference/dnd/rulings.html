<h1 align=center>Rulings</h1>

<p>These rulings helped to handle odd situations, whenever they arose.
These rules are superseded by 
<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG">Pathfinder</a> in our next
campaign.</p>

<h2>Soul Swapping</h2>

<p>If your mind is placed into another person's body, the following
rules will determine the skills available to you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Physical attributes (Str, Dex, Con, gender, size, age, etc.) go with the 
body.</li>
<li>Mental attributes (Int, Wis, alignment, level, etc.) go with the
mind.</li>
<li>Charisma is averaged out (round down).</li>
<li>Any racial bonuses for the ability points go with the body.</li>
<li>Hit Points and Initiative, functions of Constitution and Dexterity, 
go with the body, unless a modifier fits under another rule, such as Improved
Initiative.</li>
<li>Fortitude and Reflex saves stay with the body.  Will saves travel with
the mind.</li>
<li>Base attack, a function of your level, travels with the mind.</li>
<li>Skills, feats, spells, psionic powers, and languages travel with the
mind, but if the new body doesn't have the prerequisites to use the ability,
then the ability is unusable.  Feats require prerequisite abilities,
languages require a way to speak, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spells</h2>

<p>Casting <i>fly</i> on a creature that already had <i>fly</i> cast upon it
will act like the two fly spells are overlapping and the time will be
extended.  For example, if <i>fly</i> lasts for 10 minutes and you get it
cast upon yourself twice at the same time, then you get to fly for
10 minutes.  If you get <i>fly</i> cast upon you 5 minutes into the spell's
duration, then you are allowed to fly for a total of 15 minutes.  By casting
this at the end of the spell, you could fly for an indefinate period of
time.</p>

<p>This also applies to other spells, like <i>shrink item</i>.  Essentially,
the spells "stack", and as long as one is active, the spell effect is
active.</p>

<p>Using any variant of <i>teleport</i> that lets you teleport yourself and
optionally your equipment, you decide what goes with you.  If you choose for
another person to go with you, that other person decides what objects go
with him/her.  For instance, you are in a classroom with your pal and 10
kids, all of which are touching you.  You decide to teleport your pal and
yourself out.  All of your clothing and items go with you, and your pal
would probably decide to teleport with all of his possessions.</p>

<p>If you are bound, you can teleport to escape the binding.  Same goes for
people that teleport with you.  However, since each person decides what goes
with them, it is an individual choice.  If you and your pal are tied up with
the same rope and you decide to teleport yourself out, you would likely
choose to not take the rope with you.  If you teleport out with your pal,
and he (for some dumb reason) decided to teleport with the rope, you both
would remain tied up but in a new location.</p>
